In an age where patients turn to search engines to find plastic surgery procedures, facilities, and practitioners every hour of the day, having a robust online presence is more crucial than ever. Leveraging a [Google Business Profile](https://doctorlogic.com/blog/5-reasons-your-google-business-profile-matters) can help you bring in new patients and retain the patients you already see. Let’s look at why a Google Business Profile is so essential, review some tips for optimizing a Google Business Profile, and how DoctorLogic can help.

## The importance of a Google Business Profile for plastic surgery SEO

Search engine optimization (SEO) can be considered the heartbeat of your online visibility. Having, maintaining, and optimizing a Google Business Profile is pivotal for your[ plastic surgery practice](https://doctorlogic.com/blog/local-seo-for-plastic-surgeons-outrank-the-competition-in-weeks) to rank higher in search results. Utilizing this tool makes it easier for patients to discover your services, read reviews, and contact you directly. It attracts, informs, and connects you with people seeking expertise.

But just knowing that you need to keep and maintain a Google Business Profile won’t bring in all the new business you can handle.

## Google Business Profile optimization tip #1: Up-to-date information

People appreciate accurate and [up-to-date information](https://doctorlogic.com/blog/google-business-profile-plastic-surgeon.html). Current and prospective patients will trust you more if they know how to reach you and find what they need in a trusted spot. You can take the first step to achieve this by keeping your facility's contact details, hours, website, and location current on Google Business Profile. Think about it: if someone needs a rhinoplasty or breast augmentation consultation, having the correct details at their fingertips can convert them from a browser to a booked appointment.

## Google Business Profile tip #2: Updating holiday hours

Holidays are joyful and restful, but confusion over open hours isn't! Your Google Business Profile should reflect your facility's operation hours, especially during all holidays or holiday seasons. Don't just stop at Christmas; include other holidays like Thanksgiving, New Year's, or the summer holidays. If a prospective customer sees that you’re open from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. on a Friday before a holiday and wants to call to set up a consultation, you may be making a negative first impression if you are not open during that time.

## Google Business Profile tip #3: Photos of your facility and providers

A picture speaks a thousand words, and in healthcare, it often speaks trust and warmth. Uploading quality photos of your facility and practitioners gives potential patients a glimpse into your world. Whether it's a state-of-the-art operating room, a welcoming reception area, or a picture of your top surgeon with a patient, visual representation builds confidence and portrays the professionalism of your practice.

## Google Business Profile tip #4: Using popular keywords

Last but not least, using high-volume keywords related to plastic surgery, like "cosmetic surgery," "facelift," "tummy tuck," and your location, can significantly boost your visibility. By including them in your profile's description, you're speaking the [language of search engines](https://doctorlogic.com/blog/7-lead-generation-tactics-for-plastic-surgeons) and your target audience who wants to know about your services. It's like placing a well-lit signpost on a busy online highway, directing traffic right to your door.
