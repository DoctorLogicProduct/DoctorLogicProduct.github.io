It's hard to remember a time when you couldn't turn to your favorite search engine to request any information you want. In the past 30 years, the internet has completely transformed the way we send and receive information — and how we approach marketing.

While more traditional marketing methods still exist, digital marketing has dominated the field since the early 2000s. As customers [show an overwhelming preference](https://www.inc.com/peter-roesler/new-research-shows-why-doctors-need-a-strong-online-presence.html) for medical providers who have a strong web presence, it's clear that the importance of search engine marketing (SEM) and search engine optimization (SEO) for plastic surgeons cannot be overstated. When you're brainstorming ideas about how to increase website traffic, it's important to remember the power of these tools.

## Understanding SEO vs. SEM

Before going forward, it might be helpful to take a look at the distinctions between SEO and SEM, two pillars of any successful digital marketing strategy. 

SEO refers to strategies aimed at boosting your practice's place in search engine rankings to organically increase traffic to your website. SEM, on the other hand, is a more inclusive term that encompasses both SEO and paid search (pay-per-click, or PPC) advertising. There's a reason why these are two of the most important acronyms in internet marketing; [at DoctorLogic, we've helped many plastic surgery practices drive conversions](https://doctorlogic.com/case-studies/csaok) with enhanced SEO, SEM, and website management. 

Generally speaking, SEO might be your focus if you're stretching your budget or adopting a long-term digital marketing strategy. PPC will usually offer faster results but at a higher cost. Properly managing both SEO and paid search can significantly improve your web traffic — but that's no easy feat.

## SEO and SEM Have Changed How Clients Find You 

Billboard and newspaper advertising may still have niche appeal, but there are many reasons why advertising campaigns have increasingly gone digital over the past 30 years. A billboard or print ad may reach many eyes, but only a small segment of that audience is likely to be interested in cosmetic services. 

On the other hand, individuals who find you online are probably further into the marketing funnel, meaning they're interested in plastic surgery and might even be actively looking for a provider. You can further enhance your visibility by adopting a [local SEO marketing strategy](https://doctorlogic.com/blog/local-seo-for-plastic-surgeons-outrank-the-competition-in-weeks). Local SEO allows you to target a segment of your local audience with content specifically for them.

## You Can Speak Directly to Your Target Audience

While getting your name in front of more potential clients is a benefit of local SEO, it's not the ultimate aim. Good SEO strategy for plastic surgeons means specifically targeting customers who are interested in your more profitable services. [Finding that target audience](https://doctorlogic.com/blog/3-ways-to-determine-your-practices-target-market) often requires a bit of research, but the data you gather will be invaluable to your digital marketing strategy moving forward.

## As SEO Evolves, the Need for Marketing Experts Has Grown

While a DIY approach to SEO and SEM can be successful, many cosmetic surgery practice owners have learned the hard way that these tools can demand far more of your time and attention than you might imagine. Choosing the right digital marketing partner to help manage your web presence and online reputation can not only help you attract new patients, but also [helps improve the patient experience](https://doctorlogic.com/blog/patient-experience-marketing.html).
