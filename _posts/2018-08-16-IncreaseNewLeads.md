When you talk about the healthcare industry, pay-per-click (PPC) advertising can completely transform your digital marketing efforts. Using PPC, you can instantly bring in more patient leads, generate actionable data, and enhance your ROI.

### What Is PPC?

PPC is the shortened phrase for Pay-Per-Click advertising. It is also commonly known as a Google AdWords campaign. Whenever you make a search in Google, you will see a series of 3-4 ads listed at the very top of the page. The reason you can tell it’s an ad is by the little green box on the left that says “ad”.

PPC allows businesses to advertise their services and get their website at the very top of the search engine by paying for this placement. Every time a searcher clicks on the ad, there is a dollar amount tied to it. The cost of a click depends on location, search volume, and competition, along with several other factors.

### Professional Pay-Per-Click Management and Implementation
