It’s time to get more visitors to your medical practice’s website. That’s because more visitors equals more conversions from visitors to leads, and more leads becoming actual patients!

So how can you increase website traffic? We’ve put together this list of five things you can do to start getting your visitor numbers up today.

### 5 Things That Get More Visitors to Your Website

#### 1. Make it easy for people to find you.

This may seem like common sense, but you’d be surprised by how many people unintentionally make their practice very hard to find online. Don’t try to get fancy with your website name or web address, keep it simple! What’s the name of your practice? When searching for domains online, try to use something as close to your practice name as possible. If it’s already taken, try to pick the one that’s most similar.

#### 2. Lead people from across the web back to your site.

Creating profiles on other sites, offering advice on platforms, and joining online groups and communities can help you and your practice gain more visibility online. Make sure you claim all profiles that already exist for your practice, including those found on RateMDs, Vitals, etc., as well as your physical practice on Google Maps. Next, ensure there’s a link to your practice website on all of the profiles you both claim and create.

#### 3. Leverage social to garner patient trust.

Use social as a way to connect to patients on a more personal level. This type of interaction will improve patient trust and allow prospective patients to see your willingness to engage outside of the office, driving more people to your website. Also make sure you’re linking to your site from all your profiles, including LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook. If you have a Facebook business page, use the CTA button at the top to take people directly to your site.

#### 4. Optimize for search engines.

We’ve discussed [search engine optimization (SEO) before](https://doctorlogic.com/posts/tag/SEO), but it’s worth noting here as well. Making your site easy for search engines to find and crawl will mean they’ll likely reward you by sending more website traffic your way. Some SEO best practices include utilizing local keywords, creating valuable content, improving page load time, including title, header, and image tags as well as meta descriptions, etc.

#### 5. Make your site user-friendly.

If people land on your site and soon realize it’s not user-friendly, they’ll quickly bounce off (in other words, they’ll leave). Want them to stick around and explore your site, see the procedures you offer, [Before and After photos](https://doctorlogic.com/content/galleries/leveraging-before-and-after-galleries.html), patient reviews, and more? Then ensure your site is user-friendly. You can do this by making your site easy to navigate, speeding up page load time (great for SEO and users alike!), using white space, ensuring it’s responsive and mobile-friendly, and more.

### Ready for More Website Traffic?

Remember, you only want to employ these tactics once your website is up and running and has the look and feel that you want. If it doesn’t properly represent your medical practice’s brand and values, then you don’t want to drive traffic to it until it does. After all, the last thing you want is to misrepresent the important work that you do! Once your site is where you want it, then it’s time to start driving traffic to it in order to get more visitors, more conversions, more leads and ultimately more patients through your doors!
