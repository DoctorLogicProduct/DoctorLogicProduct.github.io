A strong digital marketing strategy is a key component in attaining patients within the healthcare space. It helps doctors and medical providers across all specialties grow their reach, promote their practice and services, and connect with patients in ways that extend beyond the physical.

## Why is Digital Marketing Important?

In the information age, people frequently turn to the internet to find what they need, including doctors and dentists. Research indicates that approximately two-thirds of consumers select healthcare providers based on a [strong online presence](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/doctorcom-survey-reveals-that-nearly-2-out-of-3-patients-will-choose-a-provider-because-of-a-strong-online-presence-300649353.html).

Since most patients look for new doctors and dentists online, having a solid digital marketing strategy is essential to remain competitive. Read on to explore five ways digital marketing can enhance your patient acquisition efforts and help you grow your practice.

### 1. Increase Your Online Presence

All practitioners have some level of an online presence, whether they have had a website for years, have a Facebook page, or are simply listed with their practice address and phone number.

A dynamic web marketing strategy that targets your audience and focuses on search engine optimization (SEO) can increase your ranking in search results. When you rank higher on a search engine results page (SERP), you increase your visibility and elevate your chances of gaining new patients.

### 2. Maintain a Competitive Edge

How do you stand out from your competition? Whether you have been in practice for decades or are just starting out, you must be able to compete in the current digital landscape. Digital marketing for healthcare practitioners is no longer an added bonus â€” it is an essential component of remaining competitive, especially in heavily saturated markets.

### 3. Become a Trusted Source of Information

Every day, millions of people use the internet to seek out [health-related information](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8701665/#:\~:text=The%20situation%20in%20the%20US,reached%2074.4%25%20%5B15%5D.) on symptoms, services, reviews of local doctors, and more. A dynamic digital marketing strategy can help position you as an authority in your medical specialty.

One of Google's latest algorithm updates favors [content that is helpful](https://developers.google.com/search/updates/helpful-content-update) to a reader, leading to a more satisfying user experience. Shoring up your marketing efforts with quality, user-friendly content can help current and prospective patients view you as a trusted source of care.

### 4. Boost Your Credibility

Digital marketing allows you to showcase your work with before and after photo galleries, add videos of you performing or explaining services you offer, and share online patient reviews. These features can boost your credibility as a provider and help your services stand out among your competitors.

### 5. Improve the Patient Experience

Patients value positive experiences from initial contact throughout the course of their care. Your website may be the [very first interaction](https://doctorlogic.com/blog/patient-experience-marketing.html) a patient has with your practice.
