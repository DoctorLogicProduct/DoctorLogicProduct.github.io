**New Features: Home Page & Reports**

Over the past few weeks, we've been sharing some updates on a big project we've been working on our brand new [Home](https://doctorlogic.com/blog/homepage-redesign.html) page and [Reporting](https://doctorlogic.com/blog/new-homepage-and-reporting-coming-soon.html) enhancements.

Today we're excited to announce that these great new features are now officially live and available for all DoctorLogic customers. If you missed our previous "sneak peek" updates or just need a refresher, keep reading below.

**Welcome "Home"**

When logging into your DoctorLogic account you'll now see the brand new Home page. It displays a wealth of important information about your website's performance as well as useful tips and recommendations to help your practice grow.

The new Home page provides a 360-degree view of all your top performance metrics (SEO, website traffic, conversions) and also acts as a shortcut into other areas of your account. On each Home page card, you'll find links that will drill down into sections such as Reports, Opportunities, Reviews, Galleries, and Articles. [Log in now](https://admin.doctorlogic.com/) to check it out!

If you have ideas and suggestions for other things you'd like to see on the Home page we'd love to hear them. [Send us](mailto:success@doctorlogic.com) your feedback so we can keep improving your DoctorLogic experience!

**New Reports**

With this release, we've also introduced our new "Reports" section on the left side navigation bar. This is the location for all detailed performance reporting and analytics for your website.

In addition to the three new reports that we just added (more on those below), we've relocated the legacy performance dashboard into this section as well. It just makes sense to have all reporting in one spot.

Here’s an overview of the three new performance reports:

**Keywords Report**

With this report, you can see how your website site ranks in Google search results for keywords and phrases relevant to your practice. Track keyword performance, rankings, and positions to monitor your SEO performance over time.

In this report you’ll find:

* Total Keywords
* Page 1 & Page 2 Keywords
* Keyword position
* Keyword performance

**Traffic Report**

With this report, you’ll be able to view website visitor engagement such as the frequency and duration of their sessions. In addition, you can see which channels are driving the most sessions and conversions.

In this report you’ll find:

* Sessions
* Sessions/User
* Average Session Duration
* Sessions by Channel
* Conversions by Channel
* Sessions over Time
* Sessions by City
* Sessions by Device Type
* Conversion by Type

**Pages Report**

With this report, you’ll be able to see how visitors engage with the different content on your website and how this changes over time. You will get an overview of the procedure, blog, and gallery content that resonates the best with your audience.

In this report you’ll find:

* Pageviews
* Pages/Session
* Bounce Rate
* Pageviews over time
* Pageviews by page type
* Popular pages (All, Gallery Pages, Procedure Pages, Blog Pages)

**What's coming next?**

The momentum at DoctorLogic continues to grow and grow and we're not slowing down. We already have many more updates in the works so be on the lookout for additional performance reports and a host of new features that will help you maximize the full power of the DoctorLogic platform.

**We want to hear from you!**

This major platform release could not have happened without the feedback and input provided by our amazing DoctorLogic customers. Through 1:1 interviews, feature request submissions, and all the other ways you made your voices heard -- we thank you for helping shape the direction of this release.

We are always interested in adding new customers to our Early Access Program. If you'd like to be more involved in the evolution of the DoctorLogic platform the EAP is a great way to share feedback and get the inside scoop on new product features. Sound interesting?
