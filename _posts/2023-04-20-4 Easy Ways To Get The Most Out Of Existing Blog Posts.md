For any business, generating high-quality leads grows your brand. One of the most effective ways to achieve this is by publishing original content. [Consistent blogging](https://doctorlogic.com/blog/blogging-fundamentals.html) can help your business establish industry expertise, discuss new products, and showcase who you are and your mission beyond just what you’re selling.

But what if you’ve already written a collection of blog posts and still receive little to no traffic? This is where optimization comes in. By looking deeper at your existing content, you can improve your website's ranking, boost impressions, and attract quality leads. Here are four simple and effective ways to maximize exposure and boost your search engine ranking.

## **Step 1: Use Search Console to Identify Target Keywords**

The first step for optimizing your blog content is to identify the keywords you want to target. One of the [best tools](https://databox.com/ideas-for-improving-seo-with-google-search-console) for this is [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about). Once you log in, look for the “Performance” tab to see a list of keywords driving traffic to your website. Narrow down your list by filtering by date. Select 28 days to see the most recent data to help identify trends. Once you've filtered your data, export it to a spreadsheet.

## **Step 2: Prioritize Keywords**

Filter your keyword data by “Impressions” and review the ranking of your keywords — or “Top queries.” To prioritize which keywords to focus on, consider the following factors:

* **Relevance:** Make sure the [keywords you choose are relevant](https://www.commonplaces.com/blog/5-tips-on-choosing-the-right-keywords/) to your blog content and your target audience.
* **Search volume:** Choose keywords with a decent amount of search volume to ensure your efforts will attract a sufficient number of new visitors.
* **Competition:** [Consider the level of competition for each keyword.](https://www.semrush.com/analytics/organic/overview?db=us) If a keyword has a lot of competition, it may be more difficult to rank for.

## **Step 3: Optimize Your Content for Target Keywords**

Now that you've identified your target keywords, it's time to optimize your content. Here are some tips to get you started:

* Use target keywords in your headline and throughout your content organically. It’s not enough just for your blog to be found; it must also be readable.
* [Optimize your meta tags](https://ahrefs.com/blog/seo-meta-tags/#:\~:text=Meta%20tags%20are%20snippets%20of,visible%20in%20the%20HTML%20code.): Ensure your meta title and description contain your target keywords and accurately reflect the content on your page.

## **Step 4: Entice and Engage Through Media and Internal Links**

Consider using rich media like photos, videos, or custom infographics that complement the written content to engage your audience. Videos are especially effective in keeping users on a page for a while, which can help [lower your bounce rate](https://businessassist.net/why-is-bounce-rate-important/#:\~:text=Bounce%20rate%20is%20a%20measure,experience%2C%20page%20layout%20or%20copywriting.) and improve the metric of visit quality. By [thinking about different media](https://doctorlogic.com/blog/3-simple-steps-to-make-your-videos-more-professional.html) when starting a new blog post, you can streamline the content creation process.

The final piece for engaging readers is developing an internal linking strategy to keep them on your website after they finish reading the post that brought them there. By including relevant links to existing blog posts in each new post, you can encourage readers to explore your website further. And as a bonus, internal links create a [site structure that makes it intuitive for readers and crawlable for search engines.](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2008/10/importance-of-link-architecture)
