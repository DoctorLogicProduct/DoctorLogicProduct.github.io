Starting this month, DoctorLogic is now the official member benefit partner to the AACD’s growing organization. As the world’s largest non-profit member organization dedicated to advancing excellence in comprehensive oral care, the AACD supports more than 5,000 dental professionals from 70 countries.

### Message From Our Team

DoctorLogic’s Vice President of Sales and Marketing, Andre Riley, says, “This is a unique segment that continues to grow at exponential speed.”

A strong online presence can greatly impact a dental practice and influence patient behavior. Riley says, “Our proven strategy of creating modern websites, packed with value-added SEO features, significantly helps practices display the spectrum of services they offer, thus improving brand visibility. This translates to more patients.”

Riley continues, “Our websites include a robust, search-friendly architecture that contains compelling content and a powerful before-and-after smile gallery and patient review tool. These features allow practices to showcase their work while helping patients make an informed decision. The AACD shares our philosophy, and we are excited to offer our services at a special member rate.”

### Message From AACD

Cosmetic dentistry blends technology, practitioner skill, and an artistic eye to provide individuals the beautiful smile they’ve always wanted through life-changing procedures. The AACD is the known authority among dental professionals in this area.

“Our focus is to offer superior opportunities to our members, so we are proud to partner with DoctorLogic and provide a platform where they can maximize their online exposure,” says Danielle St. Louis, Manager of Marketing and Communications for the AACD.

St. Louis concludes, “DoctorLogic will be at the upcoming AACD Scientific Session in April where they will demonstrate their products and services. We believe our members will see why so many dental professionals use DoctorLogic to grow their practices.”

### AACD Member Savings

AACD members have access to an exclusive discount on a brand new website. Most website companies build sites that become outdated in design and in visibility after a few years. At DoctorLogic, we offer a technology that is future proof — guaranteed. Our doctors never have to worry about their site becoming outdated or stale in search. And the exciting news is that all AACD members get a special discount to start on their new website build!
