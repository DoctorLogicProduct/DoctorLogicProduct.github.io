Are you happy with the number of patients who choose your practice? If not, your chiropractic marketing strategy may not be in top shape.

In 2022, the number of chiropractic offices in the United States is [nearing 70,000](https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/number-of-businesses/chiropractors-united-states/#:\~:text=There%20are%2069%2C997%20Chiropractors%20businesses,increase%20of%201.2%25%20from%202021.). To stay ahead of the competition, you need to beef up your marketing tactics. This mostly means investing more time and effort in digital marketing.

Your improved chiropractic marketing plan needs to focus on attracting visitors, transforming them into leads, and turning leads into patients. Let's take a closer look at achieving these goals and implementing effective chiropractic marketing tips.

## **How to Get Leads as A Chiropractor**

In the United States, the demand for chiropractic services is increasing steadily every year. When patients learn about this type of treatment, they rarely call the doctor immediately. The first thing they do is open a browser. That's where digital marketing for chiropractors comes in.

#### **SEO for Chiropractors**

Search engine optimization is a set of marketing tactics that work to put your website on top search engine result pages (SERPs). Google and other search engines have complex algorithms that determine which website contains high-quality content which is relevant to the user's query.

SEO makes sure that the algorithm sees your website as high-quality and relevant and presents it to the searcher in response to queries related to your services.

When users see your clinic on one of the first SERPs, they are highly likely to click the link (the first search result generates a [click-through rate of over 39%](https://www.smartinsights.com/search-engine-optimisation-seo/seo-analytics/comparison-of-google-clickthrough-rates-by-position/)) and visit the website. That's where your conversion tactics start kicking in.

#### **SEM for Chiropractors**

SEM (Search Engine Marketing) is an integral part of marketing a chiropractic business. It involves a set of paid advertising tactics that bring new patients to your doorstep.

This involves putting ads in front of people who make relevant queries to the search engines. Once the user clicks your ad and visits your website, you can implement conversion tactics.

For your ad to appear near the results of a search query, you have to bid on the keywords that are relevant to your practice. The highest bid coupled with the highest relevance and quality wins the top ad spot on the SERPs.

The main benefit of SEM for chiropractors is the opportunity to place your ad in front of a user with high potential at the time when they are ready to become your patient.

#### **Social Media Marketing for Chiropractors**

Social media marketing (SMM) is a type of chiropractor online marketing that generates leads on social media platforms. There are two types of SMM:

* **Organic** – building a number of followers through regular posts/tweets
* **Paid** – bringing patients to your page through social media advertising

Today, the growing competition and a huge variety of social media content make organic SMM harder and harder. To generate leads, chiropractors can use such effective paid tactics as:

* **Boosted posts** – show your post to the audience you choose.
* **Dark posts** – special posts that appear in your audience's feed but don't clutter yours (an important element of chiropractic Facebook marketing).

Since [more than half of the world's population](https://www.statista.com/statistics/278414/number-of-worldwide-social-network-users/) uses social media, you gain access to a huge pool of potential patients. Paid SMM offers highly precise audience targeting opportunities.

#### **Content Marketing for Chiropractors**

The key to attracting leads to your practice is educating potential patients about the benefits of chiropractic treatment. The best chiropractic marketing strategies include such powerful content tactics as:

* Writing high-quality educational content that revolves around relevant keywords (neck pain, spinal manipulations, chiropractic adjustment, etc.)
* Posting authoritative content across numerous channels.
* Designing unique valuable content for each chiropractic service landing page.
* Implementing a unique authoritative brand voice that makes your practice recognizable.


* Writing guest blogs.

When it comes to content marketing, it's important to use different types of content, including such visuals as infographics, videos, patient testimonials, and before and after images.

## **How to Convert Chiropractic Leads into Patients**

Once your target audience arrives at your website, you can start turning them into patients. Conversion tactics that must become a part of both existing and new chiropractic practice marketing include:

#### **24/7 Managed Chat**

When potential patients visit your website and learn about the chiropractic care they need, they are likely to have questions. While an in-depth Q&A section is part of effective content marketing, some questions require personalized responses.

[Managed chat](https://doctorlogic.com/growth-accelerators/medical-managed-chat) (also called live chat) is a service that allows quick and direct communication with potential patients. A team of experts staff this service 24/7 to ensure to capture ever possible lead.

By integrating a 24/7 managed chat into your website, you provide immediate answers to the patient and keep them on your website.

It's also one of the most effective ways of turning leads into patients. Instead of filling out static forms, your managed chat concierge asks questions and responds in real time.

#### **Email Marketing**

Email marketing is one of the best chiropractic marketing tactics with the highest return on investment (ROI). With the right approach, you can achieve a [3600% ROI](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-marketing-stats). Once you obtain the visitor's email address, you can start:

* Nurturing the lead
* Creating personalized offers
* Answering potential objections


* Cementing your authoritativeness

When it comes to email marketing, chiropractors need to ensure HIPAA compliance. This means that the email service provider (ESP) needs to sign a Business Associates Agreement (BAA).

Not all ESPs are willing to do it. The easiest way out is to collaborate with a patient acquisition platform, such as [DoctorLogic](https://doctorlogic.com/), that focuses on HIPAA compliance and provides chiropractor marketing services.

#### **Video Marketing**

Over [90% of marketers](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/state-of-video-marketing-new-data) agree that video marketing helps the audience understand their services. In addition, videos allow medical practices to gain a lead's trust and eventually convert them into patients.

Types of videos you can take advantage of include:

* Doctor introduction videos
* Educational videos
* Patient testimonials

Videos create a special connection that makes the potential patient feel as if a medical professional is speaking directly to them. The key to [successful video marketing](https://doctorlogic.com/blog/video-marketing-for-healthcare-practices.html) is high-quality, educational yet concise content. You can combine video marketing with email marketing.

## **How Much Does Chiropractic Marketing Cost?**

Implementing top chiropractic marketing ideas doesn't have to be a budget breaker.

#### **Website design**

If you have to build a [medical website](https://doctorlogic.com/medical-website-management) from scratch, you may need to invest a few thousand dollars upfront and around $900 per month for website management. Luckily, the ROI of a high-quality website is astounding because it becomes the driving force behind all of your digital marketing tactics.

All of the below tactics are worthless if there isn’t a stunningly designed website that is capable of converting visitors into patients.

#### **Search Engine Optimization**

If you decide to work with a marketing agency, [medical SEO](https://doctorlogic.com/medical-seo-search-amplifier) costs can range between $800 and $1,000 per month. Since the competition for chiropractic patients is high, SEO requires significant effort.

Some practices opt for DIY SEO which involves using free or reasonably-priced online tools. While such an approach can be less expensive, the ROI of SEO depends on having access to an experienced practitioner. Instead of banging your head against the wall, spend the money needed to get a positive return on investment. Any less is a waste of money.

#### **Content Marketing**

When you hire a content marketing agency, you need to be ready to pay between $300 and $1,000 for three pieces of content per month. When it comes to [medical content](https://doctorlogic.com/medical-website-content-multiplier), it's imperative to hire reliable agencies since low-quality content hurts your credibility.

**Pro tip:** If you already have content on your website or anywhere else, you can easily repurpose it for other marketing channels. It's also possible to update old content and turn it into a fresh article. Such tactics are significant money-savers.

#### **Pay-Per-Click Ads**

To generate leads with high potential, chiropractors have to be ready to pay anywhere from $1,000 to $2,000 for PPC ads per month. This includes the cost of outsourcing to an agency that handles ads.

#### **Social Medical Marketing**

While organic SMM only requires high-quality content, it's rarely sufficient to achieve visible results. You would need to invest in paid tactics that could cost you around $1,000 - $2,000 per month.

The total costs of chiropractic marketing can vary depending on many factors including:

* Existing marketing tactics
* Marketing goals


* Marketing budget
* The quality of your website
* Tools you use

You would also need to decide if you are willing to build and implement effective chiropractic marketing tactics on your own or outsource the process to a team of experts.

## **How Much Should You Spend on Chiropractic Marketing?**

The budget you set for your chiropractic digital marketing campaign depends on how many prospective patients are in your area. If you don't have a good understanding of the local market, you could be spending too much on your marketing tactics without getting the desired results.

You can evaluate the local market by studying census information and combining it with Google search volumes. If you aren't ready to crunch complex numbers on your own, you can get a [free local market analysis](https://doctorlogic.com/analysis) from DoctorLogic.
