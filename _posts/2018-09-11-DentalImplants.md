According to an [article from the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/31/health/31patient.html), “An implant to replace a single tooth can cost $3,000 to $4,500, depending on where you live. Implants to replace a full or partial set of teeth can run from $20,000 to as much as $45,000.”

With as little as 5 additional partial or full cases per month, you could potentially increase your revenue by $1,200,000 to $2,700,000 per year. If your lead generation efforts are bringing you more than 5 new cases, then the additional revenue can be much higher!

[Building an effective dental online marketing strategy](https://www.practicecfo.com/building-an-effective-dental-online-marketing-strategy/) can be one of the most important decisions you make toward running your practice. Consumers could be referred to you by a previous patient or even another dentist, but you have little control over when these leads come to you.

By investing in digital marketing, you can be discovered when consumers are actively searching online for dental implants.

Here are a few points that you should consider:

#### Define your goals and objectives.

Ask yourself, “What do you want to achieve from Digital Marketing?” How much revenue do you want to grow beyond your current situation?

#### Identify your customers.

What audience are you trying to attract? What are their other options to dental implants? How do you plan to educate them on why dental implants are their best option? How do you plan to educate them that you are the right choice to help them with their new implants?

#### Identify your competitors.

How many other dentists in your area offer dental implants? What marketing strategies are they implementing? Which ones are performing the best?

#### Decide your role in your marketing.

Are you planning on trying to do everything in-house or are you going to shop for a [trusted partner](https://www.aacd.com/index.php?module=express&cmd=newsviewpost&id=11248) who has experience helping dentists attract new patients online? Are you planning to be engaged with that partner or are you going to assign that responsibility to a trusted team member at your practice?

#### Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and Search Engine Marketing (SEM/PPC).

Building a website isn’t enough. You need to be found for the right terms that consumers are utilizing when finding the right dental implant specialist.

#### Social media.

Select the appropriate channels. When you identify your customers in step 2, be sure to research where they are spending their time online. Be sure to link back to your website from your social media sites.

#### Content marketing.

Your website should have specific pages for each procedure. You can also add blog articles and link them to the correct procedure pages. [Utilizing video](https://doctorlogic.com/content/galleries/video-production.html) can also help your SEO efforts and also help increase website conversions.

#### Mobile marketing.

Mobile search is the dominate way that consumers shop today. Make sure your website is not just “mobile-friendly” but that it is optimized for mobile. Consumers visiting your website should have just as great of an experience on mobile as they do on desktop.

#### Email marketing.

When leads do come in, they might not be ready to buy today. Be sure to nurture those leads. Email marketing can help you increase web leads to patients significantly.

#### Measure everything.

One of the major advantages of online marketing is that you can [measure inbound website leads](https://doctorlogic.com/features/opportunities/) and see what channels are helping you produce the most revenue.
