Search engine optimization, better known as [SEO](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2018/06/14/what-is-seo-understanding-the-basics-to-avoid-being-the-villain/?sh=5cb68f755118), refers to the process of enhancing a website’s visibility and increasing its organic traffic from search engines like Google. But [what makes SEO important](https://www.semrush.com/blog/importance-of-seo/), and why should you consider it in your digital marketing campaigns? Here are 10 reasons why utilizing [SEO strategies](https://doctorlogic.com/blog/seo-for-pediatricians.html) could be vital to your marketing success**.**

## 1. Rankings and Visibility

When it comes to search results, most people will not scroll past the first 10 – 15 results. Strong SEO will help you rank within the first 10 results, encouraging potential customers to visit your site.

## 2. Increase Organic Traffic

Although paid advertising can increase opportunities, many consumers ignore or skip past paid or sponsored search results. A successful SEO strategy will increase the organic (free) traffic to your website by using high-ranking keywords.

## 3. Credibility and Trustworthiness

There are numerous benefits to achieving a top-ranking spot on a search engine like Google. Along with your increased visibility, you will also have elevated your reputation as a respected source of information.

## 4. Establishes Brand Awareness

As the traffic to your website increases and your site moves up in rank, consumers will become more familiar with your brand. This brand awareness will help further establish your practice and promote your services and products.

## 5. Long-Term Growth

An optimized website with regularly updated, high-quality content will continue to rank high, improving your web traffic and elevating your brand.

## 6. Reduces Marketing Costs

Unlike billboards or TV ads, SEO provides organic traffic, which results in a significant return on investment without increasing your marketing costs. Taking advantage of [SEO best practices](https://doctorlogic.com/blog/optimize-blog-for-seo.html) on your website, blog posts, and social media can help improve your visibility to potential customers.

## 7. Creates a Better User Experience

When people are searching for information, search engines will scan for high-ranking keywords within your site. When easy-to-read content is combined with high-ranking keywords it creates a site that is more user-friendly and provides a better overall user experience.

## 8. Mobile-Friendly

More than 63% of online searches are done on mobile devices, meaning you may miss out on a majority of your potential customers if your site is not mobile-friendly. When a site is SEO-optimized, it creates a more friendly user experience as it is easier to locate within a search engine.

## 9. Quantifiable Results

You can improve your SEO strategy by tracking and analyzing factors such as engagement, conversion rate, how long people stay on your page, keyword ranking, and more.

## 10. Keeps You Current

Being out of the loop on the latest trends can disrupt your business. To stay relevant, you need to know what your consumers are looking for. Since the internet is an ever-changing environment, it is imperative to know which keywords are being searched and utilize them on your website to help you keep your edge, increase your relevance, and outrank your competitors.
