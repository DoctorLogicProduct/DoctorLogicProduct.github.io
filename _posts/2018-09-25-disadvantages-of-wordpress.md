It’s important to note that not all websites are created equally.

Websites can experience technical difficulties and may need a lot of management from an agency, especially if it is created on WordPress.

We are going to share with you six disadvantages of a WordPress website.

### 1. You Need Lots of Plugins For Additional Features

When your agency purchases a design template, they typically get fully designed website pages that have to be updated with your branded content (images and text).

However, if you want to add features to your website, your agency would have to search for plugins on WordPress. Some plugins are free, and others come with a fee. Sometimes, the plugins found are outdated and are no longer being used.

For example, if you want to add your Instagram feed to your website, you must download [InstaWidget](https://instawidget.net/).

Your agency would have to install, manage, and update the plugins. This can be difficult to manage and rarely happens with agencies.

### 2. Frequent Theme and Plugin Updates

Keep in mind that in the digital age, things are constantly changing to benefit and improve the user experience.

Your agency would have to constantly log on to your site to review the dashboard to see if your theme or plugins need to be updated. Your agency can miss this with other projects because they constantly need to be checked and updated.

Don’t forget with all technological advancements, glitches and errors do happen. You can experience broken links, or your site can crash.

### 3. Slow Page Speed

WordPress is still a slow platform due to all the added plugins, oversaturated databases, and codebases.

However, those are not the only things that can slow down your website. Large images, a lot of wording on a page, and unreliable hosting can impact your website speed.

Page speed is crucial to your website. You want a fast-loading website so your audience doesn’t get impatient and decide to leave, which can cause you to lose business because they won’t see what you have to offer.

### 4. Poor SEO Ranking

WordPress only offers limited SEO optimizing features in its packages, which is not enough to help you rank on Google.

To truly maximize your SEO efforts, you need stronger software and technology to outrank other medical practices in a competitive market.

Additionally, you will need an agency that will target thousands of relevant keywords versus only a handful of keywords. Most agencies only do a handful of keywords, which isn’t going to make an impact on your search engine rankings. More relevant keywords will help your practice be found in the search engines by potential and current clients.

### 5. Website Vulnerability

Like all things on the internet, your website is susceptible to getting hacked and spammed.

Due to the popularity of WordPress, it is the main target for hackers and spammers. Even if your agency downloads all the security plugins WordPress offers, it is not enough to keep your website safe.

Your website will likely get spammed if you have a blog section that allows comments or if you have a contact us form. It can be time-consuming to go through the comments and emails.

Any website vulnerability can hurt your credibility and potentially spread viruses to your users.

### 6. Website Can Go Down Without Notice

Websites can go down for many reasons without notice.

If you aren’t paying attention to your site, you may not realize it is down. It could be down for a couple of hours or even days, negatively impacting your business.

Then you have to hire an agency to help you get it back up, which is another expense you don’t want to have.

### In Closing

Although WordPress is a popular content management system for its simplicity and is considered an inexpensive way for businesses to get started online, think twice about building your business website on WordPress.
