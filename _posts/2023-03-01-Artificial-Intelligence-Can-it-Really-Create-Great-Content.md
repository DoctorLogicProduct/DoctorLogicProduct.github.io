The digital marketing world is abuzz with the implications of machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), and how the two could potentially increase productivity and reduce the costs associated with content creation in the industry. But what are AI and ML, how long have they been around, and can they be trusted to create high-quality content that adds value to marketing and business strategies? Read on to learn more about the basics of AI and ML and their impact on the marketing industry.

## What are AI and ML?

AI is a broad term that defines the ability of a machine to imitate human behavior to achieve a task typically completed by a human. AI has been used in many facets of life for more than a decade, from in-home voice-operated systems such as _Alexa_ to smartphone assistants such as _Siri_ and in-home devices like programmable, wireless vacuum cleaners.

ML is a subset of AI that focuses primarily on computer science, algorithms, and organizing the data needed for a computer system to consistently learn and expand its knowledge to become increasingly accurate and capable.

## The History of AI for Content Creation

AI’s origin in content creation can be tracked to the late ['80s](https://anyword.com/blog/history-of-ai-writers/), with the debut of spell-checking applications. The idea that a computer could identify an opportunity for improvement within a computer program was groundbreaking. Since then, spell-checking and suggestive text software have been integrated into most of the applications we use for productivity purposes.

In 2017, a content creator named Ross Goodwin produced the first AI-written novel, “1 The Road.” The project was partially funded by Google. Critics said that while the book wasn’t a masterpiece, it showed the world what was on the horizon for AI and represented a future that hadn’t been considered until then.

## Using AI for Marketing Content Today

As AI has become more intelligent and capable, digital marketing professionals have explored improved integration of the technology into their workflows to increase efficiency and better scale their product offerings. AI content-creation tools are genuinely beneficial when used carefully and under the guidance of a human writer or editor.

In February 2023, [Google announced its position on AI content](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/02/google-search-and-ai-content), stating that it would be “rewarding high-quality content however it is produced.” This means that as long as the quality is helpful to a reader, non-duplicative, and accurate, it will be indexed and ranked alongside all other forms of content.
