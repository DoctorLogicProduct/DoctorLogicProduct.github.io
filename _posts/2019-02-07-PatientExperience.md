In fact, [80% of consumers](https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2018/05/22/even-with-a-referral-80-of-patients-still-check-out-doctors-online/) used the internet to make a healthcare related search in the past year.

So, let me ask you this: when was the last time you evaluated your online patient experience? If it’s been a while, you might consider raising it up on your to-do list, because:

* [Nearly 60%](https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2018/05/22/even-with-a-referral-80-of-patients-still-check-out-doctors-online/) of survey respondents chose one provider over another based on a positive online reputation.
* [63% of consumers](https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2018/05/22/even-with-a-referral-80-of-patients-still-check-out-doctors-online/) will choose one provider over another because of a strong online presence.
* [81% of consumers](https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2018/05/22/even-with-a-referral-80-of-patients-still-check-out-doctors-online/) will still check out a doctor online and read other patient comments and ratings despite being given a strong referral from their primary care doctor.

Can potential clients interpret your top-quality work by solely visiting your website? For most of you, the answer is no. Modernizing your online patient experience to support this new era of consumerism is pivotal to your success. Consumers as patients have big customer service expectations and if your website isn’t offering the knowledge and support they need, how are potential clients going to gain the trust to select you as their trusted healthcare professional?

Modernizing your online patient experience provides a smoother online journey for new and current patients; from the beginning of discovering your practice all the way through to converting a patient. It’s imperative to support them through the process with the materials needed to trust you as their medical or healthcare professional.
