Whether your practice is dealing with reimbursement methodology changes and/or new technologies coming to market, the negative impact can be significant unless you have a workforce that can keep up.

Finding and retaining the right workforce might sound easy, but believe me, it is not. Ask any practice manager, “what’s the hardest part of your job,” and most will say, it’s managing the staff. In truth, managing people is the hardest part of owning any business. For more than 20 years, I struggled with this, daily. I took every leadership class I could. I studied relentlessly to learn how to be the best leader possible. I tried tailoring my management style based upon supposed generational needs. I tried everything!

Over the years, I definitely got much better at recruiting, interviewing, hiring, retaining, motivating and engaging my teams, but I still struggled often. While I fully understood that without a high-performing team around me, the practice would never reach its highest potential, I was still spending a large part of my time dealing with employee issues instead of focusing on revenue generating strategies. I literally remember saying to myself many times, “if only I had 10 of her.” Have you ever said that about one of your superstars? Well, the great news is you actually can and I have finally discovered the answer!

In the article [“Ten Tips for Filling Your Talent Pool”](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/top-ten-tips-filling-your-talent-pool-amanda-farrell-mha-cmhp?trk=v-feed&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BMqfcXLduEtTlUpigAgGBUQ%3D%3D) we solve the mystery of hiring the right people for the right seats. Following this simple guide and using Behavioral Assessments, you will learn how to identify the natural drives and needs of each potential candidate (and even your existing team) so that you can quickly and easily attract and retain the right candidates for the right jobs.

By understanding a person’s natural, hard-wired drives and needs, you are able to make sure they are doing work that they actually enjoy and then manage them according to their individual needs. This approach keeps employees happy and engaged over the long-term. This combination is how you fill your practice with high-performers, and yes, it really is that simple, when you have the right tools.
