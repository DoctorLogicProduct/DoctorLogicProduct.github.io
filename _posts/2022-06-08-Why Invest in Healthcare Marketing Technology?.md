All too often, medical practitioners are led to believe that the way to achieve marketing success is to outsource everything to an agency. However, great content is only part of the equation. Outsourcing ignores the role of technology in converting leads into patients. The best way to increase the return on your marketing investment is to partner with an agency that provides healthcare marketing technology.

Healthcare marketing technology isn't just a great way to increase your ROI; it is also legally required.

### **HIPAA-Compliant Technology is Mandatory**

For a website to be HIPAA compliant, it must have safeguards to restrict access to protected health information (PHI), monitor when the information is viewed and by whom, prevent alteration or destruction of PHI, and ensure data is safely transmitted to third parties. Finally, a signed business associate agreement (BAA) must be in place to store PHI.

A common misconception is that using WordPress takes care of HIPAA compliance. Unfortunately, that has come back to haunt many practitioners, as [WordPress is NOT HIPAA-compliant](https://doctorlogic.com/blog/disadvantages-of-wordpress.html). WordPress will not sign a BAA, making them ineligible to hold or transmit electronic PHI legally. In addition, users complain of slow page response, lack of features without installing plugins, and low SEO ranking.

However, there is a simple solution. It is as simple as finding a HIPAA-compliant Content Management System (CMS), whether individually or as part of a patient acquisition platform.

## **Healthcare Marketing Technology Converts Leads into Patients**

While your goal is providing high-quality care to your patients, you still have a business to run. Maintaining a thriving practice and ensuring sustainable growth means making your business known to your potential customers. It requires more than word of mouth; it requires a safe, compliant online presence optimized to show up prominently on search engine results pages (SERPs).

Software specifically designed for healthcare marketing leverages automation to maximize your return on investment. It not only frees you up from manual tasks, but it improves your patients' experience and boosts your online reputation. Marketing automation technology works to increase your search engine optimization, making it easier for those looking for your specialty to find you. The higher you rank in search results, the more credible and authoritative your practice will be perceived.

Investing in healthcare marketing technology is a money-wise decision. You can see your ROI skyrocket from increased conversion rates alone. The right healthcare marketing tools can help you significantly increase lead-to-patient conversions, such as:

* Real-time scheduling
* Text reminders
* Digital intake forms
* Virtual consultations
* Online payments
* [24/7 managed chat](https://doctorlogic.com/growth-accelerators/medical-managed-chat)

These features can be bought separately or as part of a patient acquisition platform.

## **Healthcare Marketing Technology Lowers Opportunity Costs**

Removing tedious, repetitive manual tasks is vital to lowering costs. It frees physicians and staff from administrative burdens so they can redirect their attention to patients. Real-time scheduling and managed chat can prevent expensive overtime or temporary staffing due to gaps in shift coverage or unexpected patient volume. It keeps working even when your office is closed, converting leads after hours.

Practices can realize similar efficiencies in their marketing tasks. Uploading photo after photo through a webmaster takes time and money. Collecting, monitoring, following up, and republishing online reviews on a website is a time-consuming manual task, as is curating and fleshing out case studies for publication while [optimizing it for SEO](https://doctorlogic.com/medical-seo-search-amplifier).

Today, patients shop for their healthcare practitioners much like they do for any consumer item. They look at patient reviews, check for accepted insurance providers, and research procedures available within a 15-30 minute drive of their home. Many want to know what to expect, such as preparation, procedure length, recovery times, and whether there is an option for convenient virtual consultations.

Healthcare marketing technology can help you produce a fully compliant, patient-friendly website. It makes [photo uploading](https://doctorlogic.com/medical-website-content-multiplier/before-and-after-galleries) as simple as using social media. A quality system [collects reviews from across the web](https://doctorlogic.com/online-reputation-management-doctors) and republishes them on your website with the click of a button. That makes your potential customers aware of your reputation and produces results.

Digital marketing analytics enables you to produce highly targeted ads based on medical specialties, locations, age groups, or specific search terms. It makes sense to meet people where they spend their time: online. Ultimately, the right technology allows you to lower your cost per new patient.
