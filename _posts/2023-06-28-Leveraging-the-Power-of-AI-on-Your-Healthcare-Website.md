As the healthcare industry's first AI-driven digital marketing platform, DoctorLogic knows firsthand the importance of remaining at the forefront of technological advancements. With team members dedicated to providing an outstanding customer experience, we constantly search for ways to further integrate AI tools into our platform. Read on to learn how DoctorLogic is utilizing AI technology safely and effectively to increase the efficiency of our products. 


## DoctorLogic Introduces SmartAI™ 

Since our agency was established, DoctorLogic has led the healthcare marketing industry by spearheading the merging of medical marketing with advanced lead generation software to help grow our physicians’ practices. To do so effectively, we began writing our own proprietary AI technology, SmartAI, six years ago. SmartAI stands for secure, medically accurate, responsible technology – and represents what we believe to be the safest and most effective approach to helping practice managers nationwide to grow their businesses. 


## Balancing Data Privacy With Convenience

While we actively work to discover new ways to leverage SmartAI to improve our offerings, we take the time to determine the risks and rewards of each new product. This balanced approach allows us to ensure the rewards outweigh the risk and that we are not sacrificing safety or quality for convenience. A great example is SmartAI Galleries, an AI-powered, proprietary content creation tool that helps DoctorLogic’s clients build and caption before-and-after images. SmartAI Galleries assists our clients in creating their galleries while protecting the identity of their patients, ensuring the process remains HIPAA compliant. 


## Human Understanding Paired with Machine Learning

Artificial intelligence and machine learning are becoming increasingly popular in the healthcare industry and for a good reason. Smart AI can help improve patient outcomes, reduce costs, and increase efficiency. But with potential government regulations and restrictions looming, each AI-driven decision must be coupled with the compliance knowledge and business strategy only humans can provide. DoctorLogic's stance on AI is simple – we let machines do machine work, and humans do the rest. What does that mean exactly? We consider SmartAI technology an intelligent assistant capable of helping us and our clients remain more efficient than our competitors. However, we rely upon the judgment and experience of humans to ensure compliance and accuracy. 



## Following the Data

Why are we taking a cautious approach to integrating AI applications into our platform? Because we understand the brilliant capabilities of machine learning. In March 2023, OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, announced that GPT-4 was clever enough to hire a [freelancer](https://www.gizmochina.com/2023/03/16/ai-hire-a-human-to-solve-captcha/) to complete a CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) to gain access to protected information. DoctorLogic continues to take note of these instances. 


Recently, we received a request to add a ChatGPT chatbot to one of our client's websites. While researching the pros and cons of this integration, our internal staff asked ChatGPT, "What are the risks for a doctor using you to respond to patient inquiries?" The response may be surprising. ChatGPT replied, in summary, that using an AI chatbot on a medical platform is not recommended. You can see the exact response below. 


## The DoctorLogic Difference

We are committed to providing the best tools available to our clients. We remain focused on discovering and designing the most effective tools and technologies to increase our internal efficiency and your practice's bottom line. As we march forward into the next phase of artificial intelligence and machine learning, we promise to balance convenience with compliance to help your facility remain competitive in an ever-evolving marketplace while protecting the integrity of your staff and your patients' identities.
