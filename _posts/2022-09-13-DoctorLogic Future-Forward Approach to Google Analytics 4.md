Google unveiled its first measurement tool, Urchin from Google, in 2005. Google followed this up with Google Analytics (commonly referred to as Google Analytics Classic) in 2007, and in 2012, Universal Analytics was released.

So it was no great shock to the DoctorLogic team to learn that Google was again upgrading its measurement tools to Google Analytics 4 (GA4). However, Google inspired minor panic when the company said it would stop processing new UA data on July 1, 2023.

So, what does this mean for DoctorLogic clients, exactly?

### What is changing about DoctorLogic's Google Analytics reporting?

Everything will remain the same for now, and all the reporting within your dashboard will continue to function as expected.

The DoctorLogic team will continue to use UA to measure pageviews, conversions, sessions, and more. Once Google phases out UA in July 2023, DoctorLogic's reporting will be powered by GA4 data points. Although GA4's reporting capabilities differ from UA, the ability to track website acquisition, engagement, and conversion metrics will still be supported.

### What is the most significant difference between UA and GA4?

The core difference between these two platforms is how they measure the data they collect. Specifically, UA uses page views and sessions, while GA4 uses events and parameters as measurement models.

Events exist in both UA and GA4, but they are defined very differently. In UA, actions, categories, and labels are counted as events, but these individual elements are absent in GA4. GA4's events involve specific interactions and actions users take on a website.

As such, GA4's model works differently from UA. In UA, a session comprises various events, page views, and transactions within a single user session. Meanwhile, GA4 tracks users' interactions across the entire website as events. This means that GA4 can give you deeper insights. For instance, GA4 can show you whether someone visited a contact page on your website but failed to click the "submit" button.

### Do DoctorLogic clients have to do anything?

If you're a DoctorLogic client, we've already set up Google Analytics 4 on your website so we can begin tracking historical data well before the UA deprecation next summer. This advanced planning will ensure you can experience the benefits of GA4 without additional installations or upgrades.

If you receive any emails from Google on these topics and have additional questions, we encourage you to reach out to our team so we can answer any questions. You can rely on our expertise -- we've got you covered!

### What's next for DoctorLogic and GA4?

This process will involve developing custom events for various page views, such as procedure pages, gallery views, phone calls, and form submissions. These events will easily enable clients to track user paths through their websites. You'll then be able to use this data to optimize engagement and, ultimately, convert more visitors into patients.
