HTTPS security is the same level of online security on banking websites and e-commerce businesses such as eBay and Amazon.

In light of this, mentioned below is a list of five of the most essential components that your website absolutely must have to become well known and visited.

### 5 Critical Elements That Must Be In a Website

#### 1. Streamlined HTTPS Encryption

There is no doubt that businesses nowadays encounter an unprecedented level of cyber attacks in the form of malware, ransomware, hacking, and DDoS attacks. That is essentially why you must ensure that your website is properly secured and trustable. HTTPS security is the same level of online security on banking websites and e-commerce businesses such as eBay and Amazon.

Moreover, Google’s efforts to deter cybercrime are in full swing at the moment. Back in 2017, Google officially sent notifications via its Google Search Console to millions of websites that have integrated forms on web pages instead of HTTP.

You must have also heard about SSL Certificate (Secure Socket Layer). But do not worry — this and HTTPS protocol is basically the same thing. You must have a SSL Certificate issued for your website and install it on your server, or Google will not recognize your website as authentic and may blacklist it.

Benefits:

* Enhanced rankings on Google
* Enhanced security
* More people will trust your website
* You will be able to automatically update your browser labels
* More conversions
* More customer confidence

#### 2. A Smooth and Responsive Web Design

A responsive design basically refers to the functionality of your website across a multitude of devices such as a laptop, smartphone, tablet, smartwatch, etc. It is the scalability, smoothness, and effectiveness of the website that you have to focus on. Notice how you don’t have to pinch your smartphone screen to view website — that is because they must have a good, responsive design.

But beyond that, having a fantastically thought-out response means your target audience will have a pleasant and hassle-free experience searching through your products. It should never matter whether they use their laptops or PCs.

The major elements that go into a user-friendly responsive website include:

* High text readability without zooming in or out
* Appropriate space on the screen for tap targets
* No horizontal scrolling

You will be amazed to know that the amount of people using their smartphone for shopping tipped the 2B mark in 2016! In addition, websites that did not have a responsive and optimized layout were significantly dropped in Google’s search rankings.

Benefits:

* Enhanced target audience reach on devices such as tablets and smartphones
* Guarantees consistency, which leads to sales conversions and lead generation
* The overall time and cost of managing on-site content is substantially minimized
* Will help you stay ahead of your market rivals as there are still thousands upon thousands websites that do not have a responsive design; these also include websites of Fortune 500 companies

#### 3. On-Site Galleries

There is no question that one of the most critical aspects of your website is your web gallery. You cannot hope to thrive without an interactive and user-friendly product gallery that accurately displays all your product categories and services.

When it comes to a website’s visual dynamics, galleries are the only thing that can make or break website success and popularity. However, what is even more essential is the fact that galleries instill a lot of confidence and trust in your target audience, and they know that you will deliver the same quality as displayed.

Benefits:

* Displaying the quality of your products
* Enhancing the customer perception and envisioning process
* Developing clear brand impressions

#### 4. Online Reviews

Customer feedback and reviews posted online have become the single most powerful form of marketing in the world. Reviews are the only thing that is holding the gap between marketing and communication. You can’t imagine how just a single sentence in feedback or a short review can move mountains for you — provided that they are absolutely satisfactory.

All manners of online business, big or small, rely on what the target audience says about their products and services online, and to ensure they have the best of experience. A single bad remark or an unpleasant experience shared on your social media handles or popular platforms such as Yelp can destroy your brand image and decrease your bottom line.

The only way you can ensure you get good reviews is by being honest, highly responsive, open to constructive criticism, and willing to correct your mistakes. That is how you ensure people trust your business and leave a good comment, encouraging an automatic means of marketing for you throughout the globe.

Benefits:

* Enhanced Google rankings
* More keyword content
* Increase in customer trust and loyalty because they know how well their opinions matter to you
* Helps take care of a lot of marketing for you
* Positive reviews breed more positive reviews
* Increased consumer engagement

#### 5. Easy Conversion Elements

The bottom line is: all the effort you are putting it to make your website successful must bear fruit must bring in leads and convert those leads into sales. However, the question here is how will you be able to do that? Do you know the type of quality you require to gain more view and web traffic?

No need to start biting your nails. Mentioned below are some of the most important conversion elements that you should incorporate in your website:

#### Optimized and User-Friendly Navigation

First and foremost, you have to be absolutely certain that your target audience will be able to easily locate your website and find whatever it is they are looking for. You have to understand that web surfers and online shoppers have zero patience for poorly organized web content and buttons. A badly organized website will repel your customers.

#### Your Web Forms

A web form is an important medium that enables your target audience to easily get in touch with you. They can send or receive vital feedback or place an order, a request for a catalog, or leave a query. Usually you receive these messages via company email. This will:

* Provide your customers with options
* Provide an effective means of gathering vital information or the information you specifically need
* Offer a form tracking all the customer data

### Bottom Line

There you have it! Those are the five of the best and most important things you need to do to ensure your website is an instant success.
