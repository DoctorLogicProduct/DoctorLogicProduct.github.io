Here are some dos and don’ts that will help you more effectively market your locations while still keeping you in Google’s good graces.

### **_Do_:** Target Local Keywords

Employing local keywords throughout your website will help people searching for what you offer in that area find you.

Think about it this way: let’s say you have a dermatology practice with locations in Pasadena, Pearland, and League City, Texas. If someone is looking for laser tattoo removal in one of those areas, they’ll probably type something like “laser tattoo removal near pearland tx” into their search engine.

This is why these local keywords are so important: if you can think like a prospective patient and _how_ they would search for your services online, then you’ll be better able to incorporate those keywords into your website.

Once you’ve thought like a prospective patient and identified some keywords, you can use online keyword finders to see how many people are actually searching for them online. Check out tools like [KWFinder](https://kwfinder.com) and [KeywordTool.io](https://keywordtool.io) to see information like search volume, trend, cost-per-click (CPC), competition, and more.

### **_Do_:** Create Content Using Those Keywords

Once you’ve identified your local keywords, create content using them. Basically, Google ranks websites by value and relevance. The more valuable and relevant your content is to a search query, the more it will be returned on search engine results pages (SERPs).

The more content you have on your website--in other words, the more indexed pages you have--the more value Google will think you’re offering searchers (their clients). Now this doesn’t mean you can just create a bunch of nonsense pages riddled with local keywords, these pages still need to offer your prospective patients _value_ and be _relevant_ to what they’re looking for!

### **_Don’t_**: Create Separate Websites for Different Locations

Oftentimes, practice administrators think it’s a good idea to simply create different websites or microsites for their different locations. Sometimes they even copy and paste multiple, if not all pages from the core website and change copy to be location-specific. This is a big NO NO for multiple reasons!

First of all, as we said before, Google uses the amount of content on your site to help rank it on results pages. If information for different practice locations lives on different websites, then your valuable content is spread out amongst multiple websites instead of one, core site. This weakens your search engine optimization (SEO) power, lowering your website ranking.

“What if I keep my content level up by simply duplicating web pages from site to site?”, you might ask. This is also bad for SEO, as duplicate content can confuse the search engines. If the sites are pretty much identical save for a few location-specific keywords here and there, search engines won’t know where to send interested parties. This, in turn, will lower the rankings for _all of_ your sites.

While there is a time and place to employ [microsites](https://doctorlogic.com/content/galleries/are-microsites-good-for-seo.html), creating them for different locations under the umbrella of your medical practice isn’t one of them.

  
Ultimately, learning how to market multiple locations can increase your practice’s website traffic exponentially, and more website visitors can mean more patients in your office.
