At DoctorLogic, we have the amazing opportunity to work with a wide range of intelligent and caring medical providers. Research shows that when patients have a gender preference for their providers, [49.8% of female patients prefer having a female provider](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327864525_Does_physicians'_gender_has_any_influence_on_patients'_choice_of_their_treating_physicians#:\~:text=The%20majority%20of%20participants%20had,discussing%20family%20and%20psychological%20problems.).

In observance of [International Women’s Day](https://www.internationalwomensday.com/), we want to shine a spotlight on some of the thriving female-led-and-operated practices that we get to partner with on a daily basis. We are excited to have a day set aside to highlight our rockstar female practitioners who have a stellar presence both online with DoctorLogic and in person with their patients. Keep reading to learn more about some of the active female-led practices we are proud to work with.

This impressive medical center in Columbus, OH is dedicated to all aspects of women’s health. With a [broad team including seven female providers and several nurse practitioners, midwives, and nurse specialists](https://pwhealth.com/providers), it’s safe to say that this practice is well-equipped to walk their patients through every facet of women’s health. Their patients agree — their robust Google Business Profile is full of patients who have attended Professionals for Women’s Health for decades.

## 2: Springfield Primary Care

Dr. Janice Sadaya-Conda has been in internal medicine for almost 30 years. With an impressive CV that features time as an Ivy League assistant instructor, Dr. Conda’s [Springfield, VA](https://springfieldprimarycare.com/) patients are her primary focus, and it shows. Dr. Conda’s patients love her unrushed manner and the way that her kind demeanor puts them at ease when discussing difficult medical topics.

## 3: Glanz Aesthetics

Glanz Aesthetics, located in Doral, FL, is owned and operated by Dr. Linette Rivera, a double-board certified M.D. Dr. Rivera’s specialties in internal medicine, endocrinology, and metabolism give her a unique skill set in the aesthetic medicine market.

## 4: DeRosa Clinic Plastic Surgery
