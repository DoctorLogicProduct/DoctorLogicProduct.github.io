#### Upcoming reporting changes: Google Analytics 4 (GA4) is set to replace Universal Analytics (UA) on July 1, 2023&#xA;

## Overview

At DoctorLogic, we use proprietary and third-party tools to generate performance reporting for your website. One essential third-party tool for tracking website visits and engagement is Google Analytics. In March 2022, Google announced the launch of a new version called Google Analytics 4 (GA4), replacing the current Universal Analytics (UA) used by millions of websites worldwide.




## Our Commitment Behind the Scenes

Over the past year, DoctorLogic has worked hard behind the scenes to make the transition to GA4 as smooth as possible for our customers. We recognized the significance of this change early on and began working on the GA4 transition for our platform just a few weeks after Google's announcement.




## What's Changing?

All your existing DoctorLogic reports, charts, graphs, tables, etc., will continue functioning as usual until July 1, 2023. In early June, you will see new versions of these reports, powered with GA4 data, added to your customer dashboard. These new reports will be nearly identical to legacy ones, with a few new metrics and visualizations.




## What's Not Changing?

As your trusted digital marketing partner, DoctorLogic will stay ahead of the curve to ensure your website performance and practice growth continue to rise. Your most commonly used reports (ex., Overview, Traffic, Pages, etc.) will function as you expect. The only difference is that your site is now future-proofed and uses the latest website reporting data from our partnership with Google.




## Additional Help and Resources

Please contact your Customer Success Manager if you would like additional information about the transition to the new GA4 reporting.



Embrace the future of reporting with DoctorLogic and unlock the full potential of your online presence. We'll achieve remarkable growth and success in the ever-evolving digital landscape.
