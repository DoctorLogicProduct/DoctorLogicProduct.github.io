Localized search tools are vital to acquiring and retaining new patients at your dental office. However, pay-per-click (PPC) campaigns for dentists can be much more effective when you understand the type of patients being targeted and what these populations are searching for. 


Calculating your dental office’s PPC budget and knowing where to allocate funds to should be done strategically. At DoctorLogic, we help medical providers everywhere tailor their [PPC campaigns](https://doctorlogic.com/blog/ppc-tips-and-tricks-using-location-extensions-and-targeting-your-local-market) to their practice’s unique marketing needs and goals so that your PPC budget is allocated as effectively as possible. Read through our suggestions for what dental offices should consider when designing marketing campaigns to maximize your investment in dental PPC campaigns.


## Location extensions

[Location extensions](https://doctorlogic.com/blog/ppc-tips-and-tricks-using-location-extensions-and-targeting-your-local-market) are a handy tool for using your office’s physical location to inform your PPC campaign. By setting up your [Google Business Profile](https://doctorlogic.com/blog/5-reasons-your-google-business-profile-matters) (GBP), you Google can enhance your PPC advertising with information specific to your dental office, like address, hours of operation, and phone number. Having a completed GBP also builds your practice’s credibility in both Google’s and your searcher’s eyes.

## Use your location to your advantage

Once your location extensions and GBP are enabled, Google may use your PPC dental campaign to show your ads more frequently to people who are more likely to visit you based on location. For example, depending on the density of dental practices in your location, patients may be willing to travel more or less to get into your doors. You may want to consider how many other dental offices there are within 5 – 10 miles of yours. Conversions from clicks to patients can depend on how visible your office is to patients who consider your practice to be a reasonable distance away.


## Consider your practice specialty when selecting keywords

Keywords are essential to generating local traffic through your dental PPC campaign. Individuals who are looking for general dentistry services, like routine dental cleanings and consultations, are more likely searching for “dentist near me,” “pediatric dentist near me,” or “find a dentist near me.” These individuals are searching by what DoctorLogic calls “practice-specific keywords.” Cosmetic dentistry patients may utilize procedure-specific keywords like “teeth whitening near me” or “porcelain veneers near me.” The keywords running throughout your PPC campaign directly correlate to the results your patients are shown.



## Strategize your deals and promotions tool

New patients are a prime population for the deals and promotions you offer through your dental PPC campaign. Does your practice offer a $99 exam for new patients or a back-to-school dental exam special? Make sure these deals are obvious through clicks — especially for new traffic to your site.

## Make the most out of PPC

These are just a few of the strategies to keep in mind when allocating funds to your dental practice’s PPC campaign. Knowing how to design a PPC budget for dental offices has never been easier than when combined with DoctorLogic’s expertise.
