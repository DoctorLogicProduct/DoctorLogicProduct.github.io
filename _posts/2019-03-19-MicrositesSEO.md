Easy direction…when in actuality it’s not. A microsite should be created if, and only if, the microsite actually serves a unique purpose.

Google has determined sites created for the sole purpose directing back to website with back links, or to boost certain keywords, is actually a [black hat SEO](https://www.wordstream.com/black-hat-seo) tactic and looks spammy. Not only that, but Google considers sites like this to be extremely low quality. And remember, Google penalizes sites they deem to be low quality. To avoid a penalty, it’s best to avoid setting up microsites unless it’s for branding purposes.

### Why Say No to Microsites?

The reasons are many.

1. It takes time and effort to create and optimize the content for microsites. Basically the same steps you took to set up your main site still applies, and they can take just as long. Imagine going through that for more than one site.
2. Search engines rank sites that have lots of good, quality content. If you’re creating microsites your practice’s content will be spread out. Your content is better off gaining traction on your main website.
3. While microsites can serve legitimate purposes, it’s not recommended to use them solely for SEO. For SEO, focus on getting your main website rank high by producing quality, well optimized content and building relevant links.
