Customer service has been exceptional and they are extremely helpful in explaining each step to those of us who may not be quite as tech savvy. We have monthly phone calls with our account manager to keep us updated on our site and what we can do to maximize growth. I highly recommend DoctorLogic!</div>

                <div class="testimonials__item-text">DoctorLogic is the best! Working with DoctorLogic: The team at DoctorLogic is top notch. Everyone I have worked with has delivered beyond my expectations. Most companies have great sales people but then after you sign-up it becomes a challenge to get things done. This is not the case with DoctorLogic. Their implementation team is very efficient and delivered our websites on time and without any major surprises. They have their launch plan down to a science and they know what works.  The content they created is professional and accurate. The relationship doesn’t end once the website is done. The account management team is committed to our practice’s success and continuously provide insights and make improvements. If we need a quick change or update to the website, their customer support team will get it done right away. The entire team is well informed and executes with excellence. The Product: DoctorLogic is more than a website development company. They are an extension of our digital marketing efforts. They build and maintain websites that are built to perform well in search results, but more importantly they are designed to provide potential patients all the information they need to convert right then and there. DoctorLogic is a true partner. The dashboard or back end of the website makes it easy to see how we are doing with a few simple clicks. The data provided is relevant and instantly available. Their tool automatically pulls in reviews from across the internet where we can easily post them to our website. When it comes to before and after galleries, we used to have to type out what we wanted in an email and send it off to our web designer and wait to have it added to our website. Now we can upload the pictures directly to site and have it live on the site in a matter minutes. The ability to listen to patient calls has been a great tool for our team. Reviewing calls to see how our staff handles them makes each call a coaching opportunity which leads to a better patient experience. Performance: What matters most are the results!  Our website pages are ranking higher and higher each month in organic search results. In fact, content from several of our services and procedures are delivered in snippets directly in google search results. This speaks to the quality of the content they have helped us create. Our website visitors are steadily increasing, and our conversion rates are better than we’ve seen historically.</div>

The keyword tagging options for photographs has increased our visibility immensely.

We also love the ability to make on page edits.  We no longer have to wait on a third party to make simple changes.</div>

The patented technology they employ to ensure your web presence is optimized coupled with their gorgeous designs, excellent back-end technology and detailed analytics are the business side and they are out of this world. But let's not forget about the human side of things that makes this company blow the competition out of the water. Working with Grace and Mary has been instrumental in getting my three websites off the ground, as they have helped me in every step of the way. DoctorLogic is amazing, and their employees are insanely helpful.</div>

This is the third time in my career as a plastic surgeon that I have launched a new site and I did so with great trepidation because I felt I was starting over.  I just wasn't getting the results that I wanted from my former site.  But this has been the easiest and most seamless process to date.  The team is outstanding and the customer service is second to none.  This platform is everything I was searching for and it is very easy to navigate.  The platform gives you complete control of your content, photo gallery, analytics, phone call tracking, and monitoring calls and leads.  It also tracks and records how calls are handled in the practice.  I am able to download new patient photos at my convenience and add personal stories unique to each case I present on the site.  Partnering with DoctorLogic has been the best marketing decision I have made to date and I cannot thank you enough for your professionalism, excellent customer service and state-of-the art platform and design!</div>

                <div class="testimonials__item-text">As a professional marketer and dental marketing strategy consultant, I've concluded that DoctorLogic's website platform is currently the best overall website option available. While it lacks some customization flexibility for experienced SEO/PPC consultants, for a typical dentist looking for turnkey results it's outstanding. Depending how you wish to position your practice, DL developers are very good at translating that into effective visuals and efficient page layouts. If you can generate reviews regularly (I'd recommend BirdEye if you can't) and invest a bit of time each month posting before/after photos/cases, the platform over time will rank you progressively higher in Google search without requiring you to become a blogger to generate fresh content. Organic traffic for a client who already ranked #1 on Google organic and Google local for cosmetic dentistry has increased more than 70% in the year since converting them from a Wordpress site, showing me the SEO and authority building power of the DoctorLogic platform. Search ranks have also increased on key categories where they weren't #1. Customer service has been very responsive and timely for my requests, and development folks have listened to and placed in the IT queue recommendations for changes to areas that will allow more customization by the client. So if you want potential patients to have the best first impression of your practice, check DoctorLogic out!</div>

                <div class="testimonials__item-text">I have been working with DoctorLogic nearly 6 months now to get my new(est) website launched.  This is always a painful prospect due to the scope and amount of effort that goes into such an important project. This team (currently I am working with Missy, who is great), is professional, responsive, and knowledgeable.  This professionalism has taken a load off of my mind because I have had the misfortune of dealing with webmasters in the past who talk a great game and produce a clunky site that manages to be invisible to SEO.  To make matters worse, these fly-by-night outfits never respond after they are paid. You won't have to worry about these issues with DoctorLogic. There are several teams dedicated to each phase of implementation and hand-offs are smooth.  This has allowed me to focus my time an energy on being a doctor.  I rest assured that the work they do will be right, and any adjustments I want will be taken care of. DoctorLogic has my full confidence and I have no reservations about giving them my highest review and confidence.</div>
