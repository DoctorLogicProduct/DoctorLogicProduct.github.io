**The Beginning of Google Maps**

The beginning of Google Maps seemed like ages ago when the Internet was really starting to take off and many of us probably didn’t have smartphones--or even cellphones for that matter. These were the days when the product was primarily used for directions and navigating around town. The industry leaders were other direction services like MapQuest which younger generations probably have never even heard mentioned. Come to think of it’s crazy to think about how popular those services were but they were never able to maintain their market share because they never adapted or at least didn’t keep up with the changing trends. 

During this time it’s important to note how people searched. A lot of people searched more for a specific address. Many listings didn’t have an actual business entity tied to the address itself. In some ways the address itself was meaningless. Now we search based on a type or a name of a business without even caring about the actual address. Google maps and others automatically calculate things for us and do so much for us without even realizing it. 

**What Google Maps is Today**

With the evolution and adoption of mobile devices, having access to Google Maps and the Internet now seems like a basic life necessity. We now have quick and easy access to directions for any place we may want to travel to in the palm of our hand--or at least those devices that still fit in our hand anyway. As opposed to printing directions out on paper we now have easy to follow navigation on a mobile device and incorporate live traffic updates making our life so much more convenient. We even know when a business might be crowded too and get information about a business without even clicking through to a website.  

Let’s not forget how amazing it is to just explore the world around us too with photos of actual locations from businesses to almost any kind of relevant place in general. In many ways these photos are the precursor to virtual reality by visualizing what it might be like to go to a specific place or revisit past experiences. In some locations Google even has a “live view” which has many uses we’ve only begun to explore.   

As searchers, we can easily find the nearest store or nearest business for that particular topic. In other words, Google Maps is now more than just a map and direction listing service. It’s actually a directory like Yellow Pages or those other big phone books people got dropped off at their doorstep. Gone are the days of trying to figure out how a business might be classified or how to find a specific type of business. Google can now determine what the searcher might be looking for without the searcher knowing exactly what to search for or how to search for it. It’s important to note these individual listings or results are now tied to a Google My Business listing

**Why is Google My Business Important?** 

Google My Business influences when and how you appear in search results. Just like in traditional organic search there are multiple factors which go into a local search algorithm. Local search is just another fancy way of describing searches which have (or at least in Google’s eyes) some kind of local intent. This means local map results will show up in a search for a specific keyword and are often associated with “near me” or “geography” related terms. Sometimes your business will show up without much effort because of the ranking factors but there’s almost always room to optimize and either improve your appearances or protect it from competitors. 

**What Can I do to Improve my Google My Business Listing?** 

At DoctorLogic, we can optimize a lot of the fields around names, categories, services, hours of operation, etc. based on our expertise and research. Some of these fields are more important than others but Google does like to see a fully built out profile so a searcher can see all the relevant information.

There’s also things which need to be done by you, the doctor or practice. They include generating constant reviews and responding to all the reviews. Google likes to see the engagement and interaction that you are listening to feedback from your audience on a regular basis.
