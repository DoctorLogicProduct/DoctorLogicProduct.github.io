**Coming soon: Your new DoctorLogic "Homepage"**

New year. New look! We're starting off 2021 strong and today we wanted to share a sneak peek of an exciting new change coming soon to your DoctorLogic account. In a few weeks we'll be rolling out a brand new account Homepage which will be the first page you'll land on each time you login.

**Homepage overview**

The new Homepage is specifically designed to highlight your most important performance metrics so you can quickly get an at-a-glance summary of your top website, SEO, and conversion results.

The Homepage will also help you easily navigate to different parts of your account so you can view additional reporting, create new website content, view new leads, or manage your online reviews.

Lastly, the Homepage will be the spot to get useful tips and recommendations to help you grow and improve overall performance.

**What other changes can I expect?**

In addition to the launch of the new Homepage we're also taking the opportunity to update some of the navigational elements within your DoctorLogic account. We'll be introducing a new Reports section which will house all of the new and existing reports that we offer.

To address a commonly asked question, the current "Performance Dashboard," (the page you see now after logging in) is not going away. We're just moving it into a new location inside the Reports section.

**Sounds great. Tell me more!**

We're putting the finishing touches on this new upgrade and plan to launch it to all customers within the next few weeks. We'll share another update once we get closer to launch but if you have any questions or would like additional information now, don't hesitate to [reach out today](mailto:success@doctorlogic.com).

**Here's a Sneak Peak of what's to come:**
