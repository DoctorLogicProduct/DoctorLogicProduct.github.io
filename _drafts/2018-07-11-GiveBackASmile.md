When somebody is a victim of domestic abuse and violence, they often feel weak and powerless. A majority of victims have no place to go. Eventually, they manage to escape their cycle of abuse. However, they lose their financial resources and often their confidence as well in the process. This can make it even harder and more challenging for them to get back on their feet. Give Back a Smile strives to change that.

Victims of domestic violence may experience trauma to their jaw, including chipped, broken, and knocked-out teeth. Give Back a Smile is a national charity formed by the American Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry (AACD). The charity helps people who have experienced the traumatizing and devastating effects of domestic abuse. They offer them the unique opportunity to restore their smile after enduring severe dental injuries. There is an immense need for programs such as Give Back a Smile. The dentists and members are giving back by helping to restore the smiles and lives of domestic abuse survivors.

This program helps victims of domestic abuse reclaim their self-esteem, smiles, and lives. On July 10, 2018, Dallas-based marketing software developer [DoctorLogic](https://doctorlogic.com/) announced support for Give Back a Smile. DoctorLogic’s website-marketing platform combines photo galleries, patient reviews, stunning designs, unique content, and a lot more to grow medical practices through online marketing.

DoctorLogic’s President and COO, Kip Young, will kick off the company’s fundraising efforts this week by cycling 300 miles from Pittsburgh, PA to Cumberland, MD and back again. The idea behind this exercise is to raise funds for the growing charity.

Through the American Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry, the Give Back a Smile program will provide cosmetic [dental care](https://www.1800dentist.com/dental-treatments/dental-care/) to survivors of domestic violence at no cost by:

* Raising awareness
* Giving survivors hope and motivation for a better tomorrow
* Providing volunteer members of the AACD

DoctorLogic will strive to actively participate in raising funds for Give Back a Smile. We will present the funds to the AACD during October, which is Domestic Violence Awareness month. Since the program’s inception in 1999, AACD-member dental and industry professionals volunteer their expertise and time to raise $15 million. The money goes toward restoring the smiles of more than 1,500 domestic abuse survivors.

Both women and men who have sustained injuries from their former spouse or partner are eligible for the honorable Give Back a Smile program.

It is worth mentioning that Give Back a Smile is solely responsible for correcting or rectifying injuries to the victim’s teeth in the smile-zone due to domestic violence. Also, keep in mind that a volunteer dentist performs an exam in order to finalize an alleged victim’s entry into this program. The dentist can also rule out any other causes for facial disfigurement, like previous neglect.

In order to meet the requirements of Give Back a Smile program, the individual must have been out of the abusive relationship for a year at a minimum.

Survivors also have to provide evidence of domestic abuse, like a signature from a social worker, counselor, or case manager. In addition, potential patients have to complete an application form. They will undergo a rigorous interview process before the charity matches them with a dentist. The dentist then makes the decision about accepting the patient into the program.

In April, DoctorLogic became the first digital marketing firm to partner with the AACD. They create websites for its members that allow them to highlight their most compelling before-and-after smile galleries.

Kip Young, President and COO of DoctorLogic, said that it has been an honor to collaborate with the AACD and that his organization is excited to take part in the noble cause that helps change lives. They work with dental professionals from across the nation. They witness firsthand how a new restored smile can affect an individual and allow them to live their best life.

Young, along with his wife, will begin cycling mid-July. Fundraising will continue through the summer with DoctorLogic providing a dollar match. They will donate directly to the charitable cause. The AACD is the authority in the dental space focusing on cosmetic dentistry. Using cosmetic dentistry, they create gorgeous, healthy smiles through innovative treatments.

Top cosmetic dentists and dental professionals donate their resources and time. Thus, they give victims of domestic abuse a new smile as well as something to smile about.

If you or your loved one has been through domestic abuse and need dental care, you may contact Give Back a Smile to get help right away. You may also apply online at www.givebackasmile.com, call their hotline at (800) 773-GBAS (4227), or drop an email at [givebackasmile@aacd.com](mailto:givebackasmile@aacd.com). You can donate to the AACD Charitable Foundation at the following address:

American Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry 402 West Wilson Street Madison, WI 53703

You can expect a waiting list of applicants in a few areas and they need volunteers to help. So, we urge you to volunteer. The AACDCF is in need of laboratory technicians, dentists, as well as other [dental professionals](https://www.1800dentist.com/about-dentistry/) to donate services and time to victims of domestic abuse and violence.

If you are interested in giving back to the community, you should definitely consider taking part in Give Back a Smile. If you need further information regarding the Give Back a Smile program, feel free to contact the American Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry.
