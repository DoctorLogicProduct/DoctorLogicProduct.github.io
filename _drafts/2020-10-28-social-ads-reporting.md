As you have probably noticed in our last few updates, we have been adding a lot of new enhancements to the Opportunities dashboard inside your DoctorLogic account. Our goal is to make it as easy as possible for you to view and take action on all new leads generated for your practice.

Today we’re back with another update: **Social Ads reporting**. Customers using our Social Ads product will now be able to view, filter, and export leads captured through Facebook and Instagram ads.

If you’re not currently using Social Ads to drive interest in your practice and acquire new leads, we can help! Contact us today so we can explain all the details and get you up and running quickly with this powerful lead generating solution.

* Work with our expert team to create a strategic Social Ads plan
* Drive interest and awareness for your practice to capture well-qualified leads
* View Social Ads conversions on your Opportunities dashboard
