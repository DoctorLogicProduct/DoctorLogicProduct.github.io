2020 was a year unlike any other. Despite the uncertainty and unprecedented challenges that we all faced, the DoctorLogic team still needed to plow ahead and find ways to deliver meaningful upgrades to the platform. The biggest reason? Our customers, and their patients, were counting on us and we couldn’t let them down!

Even though 2020 threw a variety of curveballs at us we’re proud of the progress we made and we hope that you were able to benefit from many of the enhancements that were rolled out last year.

In case you missed some of our 2020 updates, here's a quick summary of notable platform upgrades from last year:

Q1:

* **Social Sharing:** Expand the reach of your blog posts by allowing readers to share with their social networks.
* **Virtual Consultations:** Customized landing pages and web forms to facilitate remote consultations.
* **Custom forms:** Fully customizable web forms with a wide array of standard and custom field options.
