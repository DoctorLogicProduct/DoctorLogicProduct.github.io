Here are 5 tips for identifying profitable visitors:

1. Create an Ideal Patient Profile: Identify common characteristics in patients who generate the most revenue. What do they have in common? Once your Ideal Patient Profile is complete, that’s where you need to focus your marketing dollars.
2. Messaging: Your practice must indicate high-quality. Determine which type of messaging attracts high-value patients. Is it the perception of exclusive service? Perhaps it’s broadcasting you use the most advanced technology. Understanding which type of messaging drives high-value appointment scheduling is the key to bringing in ideal patients.
3. Website: Your website is a magnet for judgment that carries over towards the way patients perceive your practice as a whole. Your website needs to exude credibility in every manner possible. Your ideal patients are most likely impatient and will not tolerate a slow-loading site. Also, verify your website matches the messaging you determined in #2. If patients are after exclusivity, they’re expecting to see providers who match that term on search engines.
4. Marketing: Once you’ve established your Ideal Patient Profile, the type of messaging required, and redesigned (or refreshed) your website, the next step is to put a marketing strategy together on how you plan to attract those patients. A great place to start is with patient referrals. High-value patients, typically know a few others they can refer to.
5. In-house services: Attracting high-value patients doesn’t end once they’ve scheduled an appointment. Establishing unification for everything, from your online presence to your practice services, is vital to your success.
