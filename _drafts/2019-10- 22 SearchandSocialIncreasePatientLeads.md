Looking to increase patient leads that your website brings in?

As we’ve mentioned on the blog, a practice’s website is where a lot of new business comes from these days, which is why having a user- and search-friendly website and a [good online reputation](https://doctorlogic.com/content/galleries/reputation-management-for-doctors-in-a-digital-world.html) are so important.

Essentially, the more traffic you generate, the more people visit and explore your site, the more they read your patient reviews, helpful content, and see your [Before and After photo galleries](https://doctorlogic.com/content/galleries/leveraging-before-and-after-galleries.html), and ultimately, the more those visitors become actual patients.

So how can you generate that precious traffic and ultimately increase patient leads? Utilizing search and social is a surefire way to get things kicked off.

### How to Get in the Search Gods’ Favor

You know how important [user-friendliness](https://doctorlogic.com/content/galleries/five-things-every-website-must-have.html) is to your website, but what about search-friendliness? What can you do to your site to make search engines favor it more?

As we’ve discussed before, keyword-rich content can help position your website as more authoritative, valuable, and relevant, three things search engines _love_.

This type of content should be leveraged throughout your site, from web pages and patient reviews to blog posts and procedure descriptions.

Another aspect of your site you can improve to increase your search ranking is to speed up your page load time. This is the amount of time your website takes to load all elements when someone navigates to your site. People like when sites load fast, which means search engines do too.

How can you find out how fast your website’s load time is and what’s slowing it down? Check out [Pingdom](https://tools.pingdom.com/#5aee68dfd4c00000) and input your URL, then you’ll be able to see your performance grade, page size, load time, requests, and more.

### Utilizing Social to Increase Traffic

Social media pages are another excellent way to increase traffic to, and patient leads coming from, your practice website.

That’s because social shows the human side of your practice. This is where you really want to showcase your patients and what they have to say. Encourage them to leave reviews on your Facebook page, and connect to you on sites like LinkedIn and Twitter. With their permission, you can even share their stories and before and after photos.

Not only can social reach prospective patients on a human level, but it can also reach the search gods on a search engine optimization (SEO) level. That’s because [it’s been found](https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-seo-experiment/) that there’s a strong correlation between social activity and rankings.

_via_ [_Hootsuite_](https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-seo-experiment/)_: “We can observe a positive linear trendline, indicating a positive relationship between the number of social engagements and change in rank.”_

  
hat means social can help your search rankings, further boosting traffic to your site, further increasing the number of conversions from website visitors to patient leads.

### It’s Time to Prioritize Your SEO

Ultimately, making your website appealing to search engines _and_ utilizing your social media pages to connect with patients both help improve your SEO. That means if you’re still not making digital marketing and whitehat SEO practices a priority at your practice, you’re falling behind the competition.
