As mentioned in last month’s newsletter we’ve been working on an all-new, soon-to-be-launched Homepage for your DoctorLogic account. The new Homepage is where you will land after each login. It will display important performance metrics as well as useful tips and tools to help you get the most from your experience.

We’re just a few short weeks away from launch and in addition to the updated Homepage, we’re also adding some brand new reporting tools to give you a deeper view into your website performance. The reports will be directly accessible from the Homepage but will also be located in a new “Reports” section on the left-side navigation bar.

Here’s a quick overview of the new reports coming soon to your DoctorLogic account:

**Keywords Report**

With this report, you can see how your website site ranks in Google search results for keywords and phrases relevant to your practice. Track keyword performance, rankings, and positions to monitor your SEO performance over time.

  
**Traffic Report**

With this report, you’ll be able to view website visitor engagement such as the frequency and duration of their sessions. In addition, you can see which channels are driving the most sessions and conversions. Lastly, you’ll receive additional audience insights including demographic and device-related metrics.

  
**Pages Report**

With this report, you’ll be able to see how visitors engage with the different content on your website and how this changes over time. You will get an overview of the procedure, blog, and gallery content that resonates the best with your audience. This data can help you refine and continually improve your content strategy ensuring visitors always have the best experience possible.
