You asked and we delivered! We have received a lot of feedback from practices asking for an easier way to control the display of reviews on their website. Today we are excited to introduce **Review Pinning.**

Now with a single click you can select reviews to be automatically featured at the top of your reviews page, giving you more control over what patients see first when visiting your website.

Within the Reviews section of your DoctorLogic account, simply click the “pin” icon to automatically move a review to the top of the list. You can pin as many reviews as you like and also drag & drop your pinned reviews to set the order.

To Summarize:

* Instantly “pin” featured reviews to the top of your list with a single click
* Pinned reviews persist in their specified position on your website so visitors will always see those first
* No limits. Pin as many reviews as you’d like and un-pin any that you no longer wish to highlight
