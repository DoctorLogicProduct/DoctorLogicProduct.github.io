Blogging, although ever-evolving, has been a consistent part of marketing. It does not matter what industry you are in; blogging remains critical for improving visibility and pushing your business forward. It allows you to engage with your audience while sharing helpful and relevant content. It is also a chance to advertise differently, which is more appealing to consumers than traditional commercials and advertising. Moreover, it is an avenue to share your perspective with your audience, which can help build a solid reputation and make you a thought leader in your space.

However, not every blog you post will give you these benefits. To create and publish winning posts, you have to implement a strategy that aims to:

* Increase visibility in organic search


* Establish yourself as a trusted and credible resource
* Build authority of your site

There is so much that goes into creating a blog post, and it can be disappointing when the post does not earn as much traffic as you expected. Fortunately, there are SEO tactics you can use to help your content rank highly on Google search engine results pages (SERPs).

#### **1. Align Content to Search Intent**

Search intent, also known as 'User Intent, is the main reason for a user making a query on the search engine. Search intent has four primary categories: informational, transactional, navigational, and commercial investigation.

It is necessary to analyze the SERPs to optimize for search intent. Google rankings constantly fluctuate. Therefore, check your keyword's ranking history to know how its search intent has changed over time. Once you have identified a clear intent for the keyword, ensure that your content matches the content type, content format, and content angle, also known as the 3Cs of the search intent. You can look at top-ranking pages for an idea of what kind of content you should create.

Matching search intent means you are giving users what they want. Google is committed to providing users with the most relevant and accurate results to their queries. Fulfilling this search intent increases your chances of ranking high.

#### **2. Title Tag Optimization**

The blog post title is the first thing we see when searching for your blog. Choose the title wisely to prevent missing out on traffic and potential customers. When creating a title tag, make sure to include relevant keywords. It should communicate to the reader what to expect from the blog post. Consider catchy and clever titles that make the reader want to click on the post. However, be careful not to mislead users. The title needs to match the content in the blog post.

Title tags are essential in ranking since they help attract users to your site and make it easy for them to find what they are looking for. If your title tag fails to communicate to users, they are likely to skip your post.

#### **3. Meta Description Optimization**

Although Meta descriptions do not directly influence search rankings, they can help improve click-through rates by signaling to click on your posts. They are like an ad for your page and will get users to visit your page if compelling enough.

A meta description is an HTML tag containing a summary of your page's content for the benefit of search engines and web users. You will see it on SERPs, just under the headline of your page, although sometimes the search engine may use snippets from the body of your post instead.

To create a well-optimized meta description, use researched and targeted keywords relevant to your page's content. Each page needs a unique meta description that briefly communicates the benefits and value to compel users to click on it.

#### **4. Write for Humans**

You want users to come to your page because you offer value and solutions to their queries. As much as you want to rank highly on Google, remember that your greatest focus should be on the human reader, not the search engines.

Your posts should be easy to read and sound natural. To achieve this, fit keywords neatly into sentences and ensure they make grammatical sense. Also, avoid keyword stuffing as it makes the post sound robotic. Instead, make content straight to the point and use an attractive format highlighting your post's critical issues to allow readers to scan through quickly.

#### **5. URL-Structure Optimization**

Search engines use the URL to identify the content of a page, its target, and its purpose. Therefore, it would be best if you optimized the URL to be readable; otherwise, the engines won't understand it. Avoid using underscores; Google does not recognize them. Use hyphens instead. Also, pay attention to the URL slug, which is the last part of the URL and refers to a specific post. It should be short and simple and contain relevant keywords. Give each post a unique URL slug and avoid generic URLs.

#### **6. Use Visual Media**

To make your content more appealing to users, consider adding visual content. It is more catchy, memorable, and easier for the reader to process. Today, human concentration is minimal, so finding new ways to keep readers engaged is necessary. Visual content can be in the form of infographics, thumbnails, image sitemaps, and descriptive captions.

#### **7. Improve Internal Linking**

Internal linking refers to hyperlinking of related pieces of content within your website. The goal is usually to maximize the value of the traffic you get on a page. However, it should not just benefit you but the user as well. Hyperlinks can help users get answers to related queries without typing in the search menu, making navigation easy and improving the overall user experience. It can also bring traffic to older posts and reduce bounce rates.
