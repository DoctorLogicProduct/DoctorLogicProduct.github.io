Google unveiled its first measurement tool, Urchin from Google, in 2005. Google followed this up with Google Analytics (or Google Analytics Classic) in 2007 and in 2012, Universal Analytics was released.

So it was no great shock to the DoctorLogic team to learn that Google was again upgrading its measurement tools to Google Analytics 4 (GA4). However, Google inspired minor panic when the company said it would stop processing new UA data on July 1, 2023.

So, what does this mean for DoctorLogic clients, exactly?

### What is changing about DoctorLogic's Google Analytics reporting?

Everything will remain the same for now and all the reporting within your dashboard will continue to function as normal.

  
The DoctorLogic team will continue to use UA to measure pageviews, conversions, sessions, and more. Once Google phases out UA in July 2023, DoctorLogic's reporting will then be powered by GA4 data points.. Although GA4's reporting capabilities differ from UA, the ability to track website acquisition, engagement, and conversion metrics will still be supported.

### What is the biggest difference between UA and GA4?

The core difference between these two platforms is how they measure the data they collect. Specifically, UA uses pageviews and sessions while GA4 uses events and parameters as measurement models.

Events exist in both UA and GA4, but they are defined very differently. In UA, actions, categories, and labels are counted as events, but these individual elements are absent in GA4. GA4's events involve specific interactions and actions users take on a website.

As such, GA4's model works differently from UA. In UA, a session comprises various events, page views, and transactions that take place within a single user session. Meanwhile, GA4 tracks users' interactions across the entire website as events. This means that GA4 can give you deeper insights. For instance, GA4 can show you whether someone visited a contact page on your website but failed to click the "submit" button.

### How GA4 solves the "privacy" problem

One of the main reasons for the update to GA4 is an increased emphasis on user privacy. Many apps and operating systems are blocking third-party cookies to preserve consumer privacy, which has devastated UA.

Over the years, UA and many other platforms have depended on third-party cookies to track and measure user data. GA4, on the other hand, uses only first-party cookies that certain privacy laws allow, including General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act.

The main difference between first-party and third-party data is the extent of data they collect. Third-party cookies enable platforms like UA to track users across the internet when they visit various websites, often for the purpose of retargeting ads and remarketing.

Unlike third-party cookies, first-party cookies only track user data from the website that uses them. This data could include contact information that people enter into contact forms along with login details and shopping cart items.

While it may seem like the lack of third-party cookies puts businesses and ad platforms at a disadvantage, GA4 has a workaround. This new platform fills in data gaps by leveraging machine learning and modeling. This will involve using "blended data" that you can use to effectively measure your campaigns.

With the implementation of GA4, DoctorLogic and its clients will be able to comply with the latest privacy laws while still getting the data needed for effective campaign measuring.

### Do DoctorLogic clients have to do anything?

Put simply, **no**, you don't need to do anything to make the transition to GA4.

If you're currently a DoctorLogic client, we've already set up Google Analytics 4 on your account. In the upcoming months you'll be able to experience the benefits of the new platform without any additional installations or upgrades. If you receive any emails from Google on these topics that are confusing, we encourage you to reach out to our team so we can answer any questions. You can rely on our expertise -- we've got you covered!

### What's next for DoctorLogic and GA4?

The DoctorLogic analytics team is busy creating new reporting for the admin dashboard. The DoctorLogic team is is currently integrating GA4 into the Admin Dashboard to take advantage of any potential new metrics, visualizations, and insights that may become available. At the same time, it will harness the new data that GA4 will provide around user behavior on the website.![](/uploads/shutterstock_1994339615.jpg)

This process will involve developing custom events for various types of page views, such as procedure pages, gallery views, phone calls, and form submissions. These events will enable clients to track user paths through their websites with ease. You'll then be able to use this data to optimize engagement and, ultimately, convert more visitors into patients.
