In this post, we hope to resolve some of this confusion by explaining why aspects of digital marketing, like SEO and content, are so crucial to your practice’s success today.

Let’s dive in.

### SEO: What It Means for Your Business

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is comprised of actions you can take in order to optimize your site for Google. As you’ve probably noticed in your personal, day-to-day Google searches, the sites that are returned on the first page are the ones you usually click on, right?

SEO is a practice that helps you optimize your site in order to get it closer and closer to being one of those page-one search results.

So what is one of the most proven, effective methods of improving SEO? Content.

### SEO and Content: A Perfect Pair

Having useful content on your website will naturally (or as we say in the marketing world, organically) help your website rank better. Why is that? Because you’ll be providing valuable information and insights to your target audience (in this case, prospective patients).

Think about it this way: the more valuable, insightful information/content you provide, the more your intended audience will read it, interact with it, and return to read more. When Google sees this type of interaction, the search engine realizes your website is providing useful information and rewards you for it. After all, Google is in the business of giving their users the most beneficial search results.

### Creating the Right Type of Content

The right type of content won’t only answer your patients’ most pressing questions, it will persuade them to take action.

First, identify who’s coming to your website and what keywords they’re using in Google. Then, incorporate these keywords into your content. Knowing who your audience is will also help you know what’s most likely to capture their attention when it comes to writing web copy, like headings, taglines, value propositions, call-to-actions, and more.

When it comes to medical practices, consider the most common questions you receive from patients and use those queries to create content. For example, let’s say you’re a plastic surgeon. When female patients come to you wanting breast implants, they’re often unsure of what size implant they should get. Create a blog post that dives deep into the medical considerations of each size of implant, including pictures and testimonials of past patients who have opted for different sizes. Link to this post from your website copy and/or from a frequently asked questions page.

Not only will this type of question specifically target your audience and a common question they have, it will help them make an informed decision and (hopefully) finally pull the trigger to purchase and/or set up a consult.

### By the Numbers

Content not only helps improve SEO rankings, it increases leads and gets prospects to convert into customers. According to [HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics?__hstc=37514559.86908053a04deef209d41cbbf486b52a.1546876321479.1554916373535.1555293684484.57&__hssc=37514559.6.1555293684484&__hsfp=3887574263), content marketing gets three times more leads than paid search advertising, and 57% of companies reported having acquired customers from leads generated directly from their blogs.
