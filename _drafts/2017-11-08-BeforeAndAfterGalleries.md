### Today’s Online Consumers

According to a [study of over 1,000 consumers](https://rxphoto.com/news/11-rules-to-make-your-before-and-after-gallery-convert-prospects-to-patients) researching cosmetic procedures online, 3 out of 4 patients won’t even contact a practice that doesn’t have before-and-after photos posted on their website.

Cosmetic dentists, dermatologists, plastic & cosmetic surgeons, and other aesthetic doctors have offered “look books” in their offices for years. But the times have changed and consumers now expect to be able to see your outcomes online before they book a consultation. If they can’t, most consumers will instead contact a competitor who offers a look at these positive outcomes on their website.

There is no doubt that displaying your patients’ photos on your website is crucial to generating leads online. Displaying your work requires you to have a process for gathering the photos initially. You’ll also need to have a secure way to store them. Most importantly, you have to make sure you don’t ever identify any of your patients or you could end up in a lawsuit.

Just a few weeks ago, a previous patient of a cosmetic surgeon in California was awarded damages after she sued her doctor when her nude photos were found on Google. [Read the article here](http://www.fresnobee.com/news/local/article165969457.html).

### The Gallery Challenge

We’ve met with hundreds of doctors over the years and there seems to be some common reasons why doctors don’t have their before-and-after photos on their website.

**They’re afraid.** They have heard about doctors who have been sued for leaving the patient’s name on the photos and then discovered by Google. Doctors don’t trust their staff to remove the names before getting them on the website, so many don’t bother at all to publish their work online.

**It’s tedious.** Either they have to send it to their webmaster and wait for them to get it done (days or sometimes weeks), or they have to do it themselves — and they don’t feel comfortable working on their website content management system (CMS).

**It’s expensive.** Many agencies charge $200 – $400 PER PAGE of new content added to the site. If you add 5 separate case studies, you could be looking at $1,000 extra beyond what you are paying them for hosting and SEO.

### The Gallery Solution

DoctorLogic is revolutionizing the healthcare industry with our [gallery software](https://doctorlogic.com/features/galleries/), as we have solved all of these problems listed above.

**It’s HIPAA Compliant.** Our software automatically re-names the photo files, so you’ll never have to worry about human error regarding identifying your patients. You can also rest knowing that our back office is HTTPS secure. You can quit wasting time worrying about your practice and focus on enjoying the fruits from running a successful practice instead!

**It’s easy!** With our software, you can post a detailed case study in 5 easy steps, highlighting as many before-and-after photo sets as you want. You can also add patient information, procedure details, patient conditions, and much more with our intelligent tagging system. The best part is that it only takes about 5 minutes to create! As soon as you publish it on our back end tool, it automatically appears on your website and can easily be found when sorting by procedure. There is no need to wait for your marketing provider to get it done!

**It’s cost effective.** Whether you are on DoctorLogic’s full platform or using our gallery plug-in for your existing website, you can create unlimited pages without ever being charged beyond your monthly rate. Regardless of the plan you are on, you’ll never get surprise invoices or nickeled-and-dimed for showcasing your outcomes!

**Galleries improve your SEO!** Our full platform customers get an added benefit for SEO every time they show off their work. One gallery case creates multiple pages of content and automatically weaves to the correct procedure page. Our gallery software is much more powerful than blogging for creating higher pages for indexation on Google. Doctors who previously had 150 pages of content with their old agency now have thousands of pages simply from using our gallery software.
