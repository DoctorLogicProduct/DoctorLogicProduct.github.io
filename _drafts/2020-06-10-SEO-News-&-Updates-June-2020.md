## **June Monthly Overview from Ryan**

On the heels of the Covid-19 recovery, Google has been very busy with updates and news. After 1 month of being live, we now know the May CORE algorithm update from Google was one of the biggest on record and continued the trend of impacting healthcare related websites. Algorithm updates typically instill a lot of fear, but we have found our websites to not be overly impacted thanks to following SEO best practices and optimization techniques. It's also worth noting Google actively makes algorithm updates on a weekly basis and most of the time it's barely noticeable. The May CORE update was special because those are typically significant and happen 3-4 times a year. One other thing to note from this big May update was Pinterest. It saw massive improvement in rankings, but Google has since acknowledged this might have been an unintended result. However, it does demonstrate an opportunity to be active in social media because those posts have a chance to be seen by Google on some platforms. Be sure to ask your CSM about our social media product offering if you need help in this space.

Earlier this month, Google also pre-announced a big update is coming in 2021 which takes "page experience" into consideration. There's a lot of items that go into this theme, but it's something we're preparing for and in many cases we're ready as if it were to launch today.

We continue to optimize websites from a technical perspective, but the bigger recent updates have been around content. Our platform can now add text related content on category pages which helps open up the ability to rank for a lot of additional keyword rankings and increased performance. Many websites out there do not have this functionality. There's also additional opportunities to always expand your content, rank for more keywords, and improve performance through the use of content marketing and video related content. Be sure to ask your CSM for more information.

## **Breaking News: New Algorithm Update Due Next Year (**[https://www.seroundtable.com/google-page-experience-update-29529.html](https://www.seroundtable.com/google-page-experience-update-29529.html "https://www.seroundtable.com/google-page-experience-update-29529.html"))

1. At some point in 2021 there will be a new algorithm update which takes "page experience" into consideration. This could also be called user experience which includes page speed.
2. It's also interesting because sometimes Google announces updates ahead of time while other times they do not. The fact they announced this one ahead of time has the potential to be very significant.
3. We'll have an official 6 months before it goes live, but we're already in good shape and making the necessary preparations for the update.

## **Other Recent Noteworthy Articles:**

1. **Google Local Volatility in May was a Bug (**[https://www.seroundtable.com/google-local-ranking-volatility-bug-29532.html](https://www.seroundtable.com/google-local-ranking-volatility-bug-29532.html "https://www.seroundtable.com/google-local-ranking-volatility-bug-29532.html"))
   1. You may have noticed some volatility in local results over the last month. Well it turns out it was a bug and Google has since fixed the problem.
2. **Poll: Say Google's May 2020 Core Update Had A Negative Change In Search Quality (**[https://www.seroundtable.com/google-may-2020-core-update-negative-change-29527.html](https://www.seroundtable.com/google-may-2020-core-update-negative-change-29527.html "https://www.seroundtable.com/google-may-2020-core-update-negative-change-29527.html"))
   1. This one is interesting because we don't know if Google will do anything about it, but it appears people did not like the latest update.
   2. It's likely Google will attempt to address some of the issues in a future update.
3. **Why Google ReWrites Meta Descriptions (**[https://www.searchenginejournal.com/why-google-rewrites-meta-descriptions/370452/](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/why-google-rewrites-meta-descriptions/370452/ "https://www.searchenginejournal.com/why-google-rewrites-meta-descriptions/370452/"))
   1. Here's another instance where you might be wondering about a weird meta description (that brief overview on a search results page)
   2. In short, Google is trying to place the most relevant description based on some different scenarios. Relevancy is a big part of anything Google does in SEO.
4. **How Search Engine Algorithms Work (**[https://www.searchenginejournal.com/search-engines/algorithms/](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/search-engines/algorithms/ "https://www.searchenginejournal.com/search-engines/algorithms/"))
   1. It's a longer read, but this goes into detail on a lot of the methodology and reasoning behind the algorithms
   2. If you want to understand why the algorithms are important, then this is also a good read for you too
5. **Google Answer Snippet Updates (**[https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-updates-featured-snippets/371235/](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-updates-featured-snippets/371235/ "https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-updates-featured-snippets/371235/"))
   1. Definitely a minor update, but a big one in terms of Google's constant goal of returning relevant information to the searcher
   2. This update will allow specific text to be highlighted on a page and take the searcher directly to the specific content. However, it's only when Google is highly confident the information is what the searcher is looking for so expect so don't expect it to be a common thing.
6. **Important Answers to Give Us During Onboarding (**[https://www.searchenginejournal.com/onboarding-new-seo-content-client/367768/](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/onboarding-new-seo-content-client/367768/ "https://www.searchenginejournal.com/onboarding-new-seo-content-client/367768/"))
