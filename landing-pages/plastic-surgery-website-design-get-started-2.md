  headline: Why DoctorLogic Was the Clear Choice for VIP Plastic Surgery
  text: VIP Plastic Surgery initially worked with several vendors, who were costly
    and unable to fulfill their promises of attracting patient leads through website
    traffic. Since partnering with DoctorLogic, VIP Plastic Surgery saw a growth in
    Page 1 keywords by 1,642%, resulting in an increase in website visits by 102%,
    a 55% increase in website leads, and a 10% lead-to-patient conversion rate. In
    addition to keyword ranking, the Before and After Photo Gallery brings in 67%
    of all page view traffic, with 34% leads coming strictly from the gallery page.
