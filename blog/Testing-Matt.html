			<p class="post__title--intro"> Three years ago, in his driveway in Salem, Rich Benoit rigged some ropes and pulleys and did something that could modestly be described as a bad idea.</p>

		<p>He pulled a 1,300-pound, 400-volt battery out of a Tesla that had been underwater.</p>

<p>And then, with no real clue of what he was doing, he opened it and tried to fix it.</p>

<p>“It was terrifying,” Benoit says now.</p>

<p>It was also the beginning of what has become one of the more interesting narratives in these early days of the modern era of the electric car, one that asks and answers a lot of questions and has turned the 36-year-old Benoit — a father of three who works in IT in Boston — into one of its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfV0_wbjG8KJADuZT2ct4SA" title="www.youtube.com">early superstars</a>.</p>

<p>The Tesla that started it all, a Model S that Benoit refers to as Delores, was purchased from a salvage yard after it had been caught in a flood in New Jersey. Benoit had a friend who owned a Model S, and the moment he pulled it into Benoit’s driveway to take him for a ride, Benoit was obsessed. The way it was whisper quiet. The impossible acceleration from zero to I-feel-like-I’m-on-a-roller-coaster-and-about-to-throw-up in an instant. The way he could feel all of the work that went into creating the vehicle, a history of progress that combined to create this feeling of the future.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We’re in a society where if you need to know something you Google it, but there was nothing out there, no one who knew how to fix them.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“It was like a laptop on wheels,” he says. “The perfect mixture of my two things: tech and cars.”</p>

<p>He had to have one, but a new Model S starts at $76,000 and can run as high as $133,000. That wasn’t happening. So he purchased Delores for $14,000, with the idea that he was going to do something no amateur mechanic had done before. He was going to rebuild a Tesla.</p>

<p>“I felt like a trailblazer,” Benoit says of pulling everything in the car apart and figuring out how it worked. “We’re in a society where if you need to know something you Google it, but there was nothing out there, no one who knew how to fix them.”</p>

<p>It was the ultimate DIY project, with no guidance from Tesla. Benoit says the company skirts the state’s Right to Repair Initiative, which was passed by voters in 2012 and requires manufacturers to allow vehicle owners access to the same diagnostic and repair information made available to dealerships and authorized repair centers. “They get away with this because they don’t have any dealerships,” Benoit says. “You order your car online.”</p>

<p>Undeterred, Benoit stripped the car, tore out all of the ruined electronics, and pried out the seats, which had rusted in place, thanks to the saltwater. Then he contacted Tesla to order the parts he needed for the rebuild, and it was here that Benoit hit another obstacle, one that would define the arc of his story.</p>

<p>Tesla does not want anyone working on its cars besides Tesla, and it refused to sell Benoit the parts he wanted.</p>

<p>A Tesla representative, in a statement to the Globe, said “there are significant safety concerns when salvaged Teslas are repaired improperly or when Tesla parts are used outside of their original design intent, as these vehicles could pose a danger to both the mechanic and other drivers on the road.”</p>
