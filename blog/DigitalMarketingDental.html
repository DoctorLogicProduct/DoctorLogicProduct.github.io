		<p>Digital marketing has revolutionized the world of marketing and is therefore considered to be an absolute must for every business. Now more than ever, patients seek help from <a href="https://doctorlogic.com/features/reviews">different sources available</a> on the internet when trying to decide their healthcare options.</p>

<p>In this article, we will explain the importance of digital marketing for dentists and how it can be achieved.</p>

<h3 id="importance-of-digital-marketing-for-dentists">Importance of Digital Marketing for Dentists</h3>

<p>Traditional advertising techniques involved the use of yellow pages, newspaper advertisements, and direct mail. However, in today’s world, marketing is not only about reaching out to customers but also about building a strong brand identity and maintaining a loyal customer base.</p>

<p>While there is no doubt that some of the traditional dental marketing techniques might still be helpful, they are considered to be costly and time consuming compared to digital marketing.</p>

<p>Digital marketing gives you a chance to communicate what sets your dental practice apart in some of the most easily consumed and appealing ways. The ROI that is generated from digital marketing is much higher than that from traditional advertising methods.</p>

<p>Moreover, with the help of digital marketing, you can easily reach out to a much larger customer base and increase the exposure of your business significantly.</p>

<p>Lastly, digital marketing enables businesses to target the right kind of audience with the help of advanced analytics and research methods. Generating leads and converting the audience into loyal customers has become extremely efficient with the help of digital marketing.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-incorporate-digital-marketing-for-dentists">How to Incorporate Digital Marketing for Dentists</h3>

<h4 id="1-video-marketing">1. Video Marketing</h4>

<p><a href="https://doctorlogic.com/services/video/">Video marketing</a> is one of the most talked about topics in marketing these days. This popularity can be attributed to the power of this medium to attract customers in an effective way.</p>

<p>It is believed that by 2019, 80% of the traffic over the internet will be video. It is because of this phenomenal growth patterns that successful digital marketing for dentists entails the use of <a href="https://doctorlogic.com/services/video/">video production</a>.</p>

<p>You can use video marketing to communicate about your brand (corporate videos) or use it to share reviews from patients (testimonial videos).</p>

<p>Video marketing does not only help you retain the interest of the viewer because of its visual appeal, but also increases the exposure of your business since videos are <a href="https://doctorlogic.com/services/video/">easier to share</a>across different platforms.</p>

<h4 id="2-reviews">2. Reviews</h4>

<p>To make your practice <a href="https://doctorlogic.com/features/reviews/">gain credibility</a> amongst the patients, you need to make sure that there are various reviews shared by old or current customers.</p>

<p>It is believed that 88% of customers base their purchase decision on online reviews. This is why it’s so important to not only have reviews, but also <a href="https://doctorlogic.com/features/reviews/">list them across your website</a>.</p>

<h4 id="3-blog">3. Blog</h4>

<p>Whether it is dental marketing we are talking about or any other form of marketing, a blog is another way to set your practice apart. To enhance the exposure of your dental practice, you can add a blog section to your main website which attracts people looking for solutions to their dental problems.</p>

<p>A blog carries general information about a particular subject and is meant to educate the masses about the different solutions available to them. By incorporating helpful keywords into your blog posts and including CTAs, you can convert your blog into a source for attracting potential customers.</p>

<h4 id="4-ppc--seo">4. PPC &amp; SEO</h4>

<p>With 85% of internet users seeking help from search engines to make buying decisions, you need to make sure that your business remains on top of the search engine list.</p>

<p><a href="https://doctorlogic.com/services/ppc/">Paid search advertising</a> requires you to pay the search engine whenever your ad is clicked. It helps you target customers on the basis of their intent and with the use of appropriate Call to Action, you can convert these individuals into customers.</p>

<p><a href="https://doctorlogic.com/services/ppc/">The PPC (paid per click) model</a> is therefore considered to be useful when trying to increase awareness and attract more customers. Moreover, when it comes to content, you need to ensure that your dental marketing techniques incorporate the use of relevant keywords.</p>

<h4 id="5-social-media">5. Social Media</h4>

<p>Having a strong social media presence in today’s competitive world is an essential part of your overall dental marketing strategy. Through social media platforms, you can reach a larger audience as well as get access to valuable information about their likes and dislikes. You can then use this information to come up with a marketing campaign that addresses all these elements.</p>

<p>Digital marketing is all about understanding the customers better and targeting them according to their needs and wants. You can also use social media platforms to build strong relationships with your existing customer base, something that is absolutely essential to the success of any business related to healthcare.</p>

<h4 id="6-local-search">6. Local Search</h4>

<p>According to HubSpot, 50% of the customers who carry out a local search on their mobile phones end up visiting the location within a day. This is why it is important that you focus your content strategy on becoming every search engine’s favorite in terms of local search appearance.</p>
