		<p>However, recent studies have shown that patient satisfaction at a practice is not just limited to a surgeon’s expertise, but also subtle factors such as the ambiance, waiting time, and staff behavior.</p>

<p>The best way for plastic surgeons to get overall <a href="https://doctorlogic.com/features/reviews/">feedback of their overall service</a> is to register at popular review websites and gather critical patient feedback that can help make further improvements at their practice.</p>

<h3 id="benefits-for-plastic-surgeons-to-be-on-review-sites">Benefits for Plastic Surgeons to be on Review Sites</h3>

<p>###</p>

<h4 id="1-helps-in-attracting-more-patients">1. Helps in attracting more patients</h4>

<p>Surveys suggest that one of the first things that potential patients look for while choosing their plastic surgeon is online reviews. If you are a 21st-century plastic surgeon, providing best quality service to your patients, you cannot just rely on word-of-mouth advertising to gain exposure for your business. You need to make your presence felt in <a href="https://doctorlogic.com/features/reviews/">online reviews</a>.</p>

<h4 id="2-makes-yourself-visible-to-the-local-population">2. Makes yourself visible to the local population</h4>

<p>Registering your plastic surgery on review websites such as Yelp acts as a useful plastic surgery marketing tool for your local community. If the patient is in the vicinity of your practice and is searching for a nearby plastic surgery practice, they can view your facility on search websites such as Google and contact you immediately. This will increase your number of patients and can promote repeat customers as well.</p>

<h4 id="3-helps-in-identifying-areas-of-improvement">3. Helps in identifying areas of improvement</h4>

<p>Even constructive criticism about your practice can be beneficial for your business. If a patient points out that there was a long waiting queue at the practice, then you can improve your queue management system or introduce items such as a TV or magazines to keep your patients busy while they wait for their turn.</p>

<p>Once you have made arrangements to improve your services, you can reply to the comment about the additions to your practice. This will promote the idea that your patients’ concerns are always valuable to you.</p>
